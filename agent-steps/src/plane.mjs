/* -------------------------------------------------- D-276: THE ANSWER, NOT THE WIRE
 *
 * A REFUSAL THAT ARRIVES AS A WELL-FORMED HTTP RESPONSE IS STILL A REFUSAL, and
 * this is the one place in this member that says so. `askPlane` answers the
 * TRANSPORT question — did the plane answer at all — and nothing more. Reading
 * `.reached` and then taking fields off the body treats `{ok: false, reason:
 * MEANING_ROWS_UNKNOWN_ARM}` as an answer with no rows in it, which is how
 * D-276 turned the plane's own false-coverage fence into false coverage: the
 * run note said `0 meaning-grain row(s) queried` for a call that never
 * succeeded, and that note lands in an AI run's OBSERVATION ENTRIES, which are
 * record. CLAUDE.md: *"no meaning derived may mean nothing was extracted;
 * nothing extracted may mean the document was never read; no document may mean
 * nobody looked"* — saying WHICH is a first-class obligation, and "the record
 * was not asked" is a fourth sentence that must never be written as the first.
 *
 * REC-52/REC-53 swept exactly this shape through the plane — a silence or a
 * refusal turning into a normal-looking answer. This is that lesson on the
 * member side, and it is a FUNCTION rather than a rule so that a new call site
 * cannot get it wrong quietly: there are three outcomes and a caller must
 * handle each by name.
 *
 *   { silent }   the plane did not answer. Nothing is known about the record.
 *   { refused }  the plane answered, and its answer is NO. The code, the
 *                C-number and the plane's own body travel with it — this member
 *                re-words no refusal (A6).
 *   { result }   the plane answered YES, and this is what it said.
 *
 * AND THE REFUSAL IS NOT WHERE A READER EXPECTS IT — MEASURED 2026-08-09 BY
 * DRIVING THE REAL PLANE, and it is why "check `ok`" is only half the fix.
 * `op=meaningrows` refusing an unknown arm answers **HTTP 200** with a
 * **TOP-LEVEL `ok: true`**, because the control plane wraps whatever the Durable
 * Object returned:
 *
 *   { ok: true, result: { ok: false, reason: "MEANING_ROWS_UNKNOWN_ARM",
 *                         check: "C-23.2", translation: "…" }, store, tokenClass }
 *
 * A member that tested the ENVELOPE's `ok` would have read that as a successful
 * call, exactly as the member that tested `.reached` did — the same defect one
 * layer in. So the answer is the innermost object that states its own `ok`, and
 * a call is refused when EITHER the envelope or that object says no. An op whose
 * result carries no `ok` at all (`op=airunspawn`, `op=basisversions`) is
 * unaffected: the envelope is then the only thing that speaks.
