# The layers

**Status** · APPROVED by Bob 2026-09-25 (TRANSITION.md T4), AMENDED by Bob 2026-09-26 (the Action layer, layer 9, splitting the old layer 8 into Publication (8) and Operations (10)). 11 layers. A view of it is `layers-view.html`, beside this file. The modules, in their total order, are in `modules.json`. Each layer's modules may use modules earlier in the order only (P4). The record of each split and amendment, with its rulings and line counts, is in `plan/archive/layers-history.md` (moved out 2026-10-17, K3679); this file holds only what binds a job working in a layer today.

## No jurisdiction in the product (Bob's concern, 2026-09-25; ruled by BOB #37)

Bob: CivicOS must not carry so many outward-facing references to Oakland and Alameda County that a group elsewhere concludes it is not for them. Measured the same day: local knowledge is written into code (identifier spaces and publishing systems in `idspaces.mjs`; council headers and municipal-code citations in 12 `docprofile/` files; a default search term of "oakland" in `store.mjs`), and the installer's outward text brands itself "Believe in Oakland".

1. **Product code and its outward text name no jurisdiction.** Everything local lives as DATA in a **jurisdiction profile**: identifier spaces and their forms, publishing systems and their addresses, coverage floors, the vocabulary document recognisers match, default search terms. A profile names the measurement each fact rests on.
2. **The `jurisdictions` module holds the profiles** (layer 1, first after `legacy-checks`). Oakland and Alameda County are its first profile, the one the project's own instance uses. An instance may use several profiles; which ones is an instance setting chosen at install.
3. **A module that needs local knowledge takes it from a profile.** Its requirements are stated for any jurisdiction, and its tests include at least one profile that is not Oakland's.
4. **Outward text names the product (CivicOS) and the group.** Believe in Oakland is named only where it is the fact: as the publisher and signer of a release.
5. A requirement that names a place is a defect in the requirement, except in the `jurisdictions` module's profile data.
6. **Provenance is not a jurisdiction.** A comment, a test or a basis string that says where a measurement was taken (an Oakland document, M-157) records a fact about the evidence and is allowed. The rule governs behaviour and outward text.

The work this makes is in `plan/next.md`. The UI is worked on elsewhere and carries the same rule.

## The legacy modules (PROCESS-MECHANICS §12)

`legacy-checks`, `legacy-store`, `legacy-index` and `legacy-tests` are retired (K858 at T19's close, 2026-10-01; K1006, N478 at T22's opening). Their rows, with their line counts, are in `plan/archive/layers-history.md`. What remains binding:

| legacy module | file | why it sits where it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| legacy-ui | `civicos-ui/` | **Retired** at T51 (T51-126, K4100): deleted whole, every feature reimplemented on the new design (K3803, K3807). No legacy module remains. |

`src/index.mjs` stays as plane's one-line re-export until bundler's T20 job (K846). The old battery (legacy-tests) tested every layer, so it was last in the order and might use anything earlier (BOB #38, P17); the extracted modules' own tests live in `bio-plane/test/m/<module>/`, which the most specific path assigns to each module. A module marked `from` in `modules.json` is extracted from a legacy module by its own job; the extraction job reads the legacy code and confirms which functions go to the module.

## Bob's rulings on the draft, 2026-09-25

1. **No size limit.** A module's size is a metric, not a bound. BOB reports any module that approaches about 4,000 lines of code (P6, P14).
2. **Ops move with their construct.** Each op's handler moves at extraction into the module whose service it is. `control-plane` keeps only routing, authentication and the response envelope.
3. **Each module owns its tables.** `schema.mjs` is divided at extraction.
4. **The UI is a placeholder, worked on elsewhere.** *(Superseded: the new interface is built in layer 11 and `legacy-ui` was retired at T51, K4100.)* `legacy-ui` stays registered, so every product file has an owner, but no tranche plans work on it. Its replacement is placed in the top layer when it arrives. At T5, a row about the UI itself is dropped for that reason; a row about a plane service the UI needs is carried against the plane module that provides it.
5. **Moving a function.** BOB moves a function between modules when the order and the declared uses still hold, and reports the move to Bob. *Amended 2026-09-26 by P17:* a change to a layer, or adding or removing a module that carries product capability, comes to Bob; `uses` edges, order within a layer, file ownership and helper or legacy modules are BOB's, decided and reported.
6. **`promotion` starts in layer 2.** If it needs a later module, it moves up with Bob's approval.

**The checks are carried, never dropped (Bob: "very important to keep").** Every check in `bio-checks.mjs` moves, at extraction, into exactly one module, as an invariant with its own requirement id and test. `legacy-checks` is retired only when it is empty. A check is removed only by a recorded ruling.

## Layer 7, Understanding (Bob, 2026-09-25)

Bob asked whether a layer between investigation and publication belongs in the architecture. BOB proposed it from `BIO_Content_Framework_v0_10.md` §12 (*Intent: goals, objectives, aspirations, and the discovery loop*, RULED by Bob 2026-07-30), and Bob approved it the same day. A layer is named for what it provides; this one provides the group's understanding.

| module | what it does | source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| intent | Holds aspirations, goals and objectives. An objective has a satisfaction condition, so its progress is computed from the record and never reported, and its gaps are the work list. Unasked-for findings arrive as proposals, and a member adopts them, turns them into a focus or a problem, or defers them with a recorded reason (the discovery loop). | §12. Aspiration and goal are not built; the objective lives on the project today. |
| reevaluation | When something a finding rests on changes (a new version of a passage, a weaker derivation, a changed grade), it says which findings are affected, and how. | `reevaluations`, `versionNotice` and `changedFromAudit` in `store.mjs` |

What the layer above gets from it: monitoring watches what objectives and findings rest on; scheduling orders work by the priority aspirations set and the gaps objectives leave; publication knows which findings still stand, and which run against a goal (Invariant 7). The assistant works an objective when intent hands it one, so `ai-runs` does not depend on `intent`.

**Beyond MVP: Discovery (Bob's candidate, 2026-09-25, not in the module list).** An AI assistant that searches documents, content, meaning and the results of inquiries for an understanding of what is working and what is not. It would sit in this layer. It enters `modules.json` only when Bob adds it.

## Layer 9, Action (Bob, 2026-09-26; drafted by BOB #38, APPROVED by Bob the same day)


**Where it sits.** After publication, because a finding is published before a group acts on it, and a filing leaves the instance the way publication delivers. Before monitoring, because monitoring watches the actions' clocks and the government's response. So the old layer 8 split, and the order is: 7 Understanding · **8 Publication** (publication) · **9 Action** · **10 Operations** (monitoring, scheduler, legacy-store) · 11 Interface and distribution.

**Contract.** An action rests on the record, and one asserting a breach rests on a published finding and on a standard held in the record. The group plans and decides every act; the AI proposes and prepares, and never files or sends. Compliance is documented as carefully as noncompliance. Every deadline names its basis: a law or order, a commitment, a dependency (the event it must precede, and why) or the group's own window. *(Amended by Bob 2026-09-29/30, K590 (1), (5), (10), D1; K608; 2026-10-05, K1431.)*

| module | what it does | source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| standards | The conformance requirements a government act is measured against: a statute, regulation, court decision or order, adopted policy, or public commitment. Each is held as content in the record, with its citation and the period it was in force. Which laws and bodies exist comes from the jurisdiction profile. | Functional Architecture, Function 1 and the Legal/Policy Lookup skill |
| conformance | The determination that a named government act is compliant, noncompliant or unclear against named standards, resting on findings published, checked for publication and held (D23), or accepted from another group's case (K2851). Unclear sends the question back to inquiry. A compliant determination is recorded too. It does not rank significance; that is a member's judgment, made with the consequences in front of them. | Functional Architecture, analysis outputs and Function 4 |
| consequences | What the breach did, and to whom: who or what is affected (a class of people, a fund, a program, a service), the measure (money, benefits, services, time, counts) and the period. Computed from the record where the record holds the figures, each with its basis and grade. Where it cannot be computed it is marked undetermined, and the module supports members in determining it from the record together with their own assessment, each part recorded as what it is (computed, or a member's assessment, with who made it and on what). That a harm follows from the act is itself a finding that needs evidence, never assumed. People are counted as a class, or a harmed person a document names is named in the record; published text names them only with their consent or where Design Requirement 6 allows, and a whistleblower who is a source stays protected (K1484). Escalation's exit condition ("consequences addressed") is checked against it. | Bob, 2026-09-26; Roadmap OP6; Functional Architecture Function 4 ("informed by context, scale, pattern, and consequences") |
| actions | The Action object (moved from layer 6): kind, risk tier, counterparty, clock entries each with its basis, lifecycle, correspondence. It rests on a conformance determination. | State Rules §4.4; carries REC-215, REC-201, D-689, D-579 |
| action-clocks | Split from `actions` (K617, for size; no requirement changed meaning): an action's clock entries read across actions (the pending and the overdue), the entries proposed from the profile's deadlines, counted in calendar or business days on the profile's holiday calendar, and the reminders a member asks for on them (DEC-94), fired as asked. | State Rules §4.4; `BIO_Action_v0_1.md` §4 rule 5; K613–K615, K617 |
| filings | What the group sends: Tier 1 and 2 filings pre-filled from the record; for Tier 3, a **counsel packet** for counsel the group names: the facts with their citations, a chronology, exhibits with provenance, the standards' text, candidate legal theories and remedies, and any deadline that binds a claim. It is marked as prepared for counsel's review, is never published, and is never in a form that can be filed as it stands. Counsel drafts and files. The kinds, templates and venues come from the jurisdiction profile. | Design Requirements §8, Roadmap §8 |
| escalation | The stages (discovery and documentation, notification, clock starts, response evaluation, legal tools, sustained attention, and political accountability, ruled below), each with entry and trigger conditions; the next stage is proposed when its trigger is met, and a member advances it. It ends only when compliance is restored and the consequences are addressed. | Design Requirements §7, Functional Architecture Functions 3 and 5 |
| action-plans | A project's working material for deciding what to do about one or more matters, suspected (an inquiry still open) or determined (a determination's outcomes): options the assistant suggests or a member adds, each bound to the matters it serves; the member's choice; up to three scenarios over time with checkpoints a member judges; and the link from each started option to the action it created. No catalogue of options, no budgets, never published; a member closes it with a reason. | `BIO_Action_v0_1.md` §3–§4; Bob, 2026-09-29 and 2026-09-30 (K590) |

**Bob's rulings on the draft (2026-09-26).**
1. *Significance.* Consequences are computed from the record where it holds the figures; where they cannot be, they are marked undetermined, and members determine them from the record and their own assessment (the `consequences` row above). Significance, whether a breach warrants action and how urgently, stays the member's judgment.
2. *Tier 3.* `filings` prepares a counsel packet for named counsel (the `filings` row). This amends Design Requirement 8.
3. *Political stage.* Escalation gains stage 7, **political accountability**, entered from response evaluation or legal tools and aimed at compliance restored and consequences addressed: asking elected officials to act on the breach, oversight and audit requests, testimony, and legislation that restores or enforces an existing requirement. Policy advocacy and candidate support stay out; Operational Principle 1 stands. This amends Design Requirement 7.

## Helper modules (BOB #38, 2026-09-26, under P17)

Found by the architecture check's first run: shared helpers that later modules used from the top of the order.
- **test-support** (layer 1): the test sandbox and stdio guard (`bio-plane/test/sandbox.mjs`, `stdio.mjs`) that the workers' tests and the kept suites share.
- **bundler** (layer 1): `bio-plane/scripts/fleet-bundle.mjs` and its `provenance.mjs`, which build the plane and the three workers.
- **record-grammar** (layer 1, first in the order; K578, K585 (4), K589, formed at T18's opening): the record's shared grammar below every module that reads or writes a document (the id and type vocabulary, the restricted front-matter parser, canonical JSON, actor identity, the grade vocabulary, the public-locator test and the one SHA-256), moved out of `legacy-checks` in stages, each part whole, the catalogue re-exporting it until its importers re-point (PROCESS-MECHANICS §12.2). It holds no store, no network and no clock.
- **journey-check** (layer 11, last, after `stewards`; T47-88, K1043, K3100): the release check, a Playwright walk of journeys 28 and 3 against the installer, a local plane or a named test instance, over HTTP only; it carries no product capability, imports no module and is imported by none.

Declared uses the code already had were added (affordances, query-language and skills on legacy-checks; agent-worker on runtime-limits, legacy-checks, query-language, ai-runs and skills; ocr-worker on legacy-checks and text-chain), `skills` moved after `ai-runs`, and `ai-runs`'s stale use of `skills` was removed. `not_product` in `modules.json` lists the paths no module owns.

## Paths that are not product

`docs/`, `requirements/`, `build/`, `tools/`, `release/` and the old process's `.claude/` hooks are not modules. `release/` is produced by the distribution process (mechanics §11). `tools/` is the old process's tooling, retired at T7 (TRANSITION §5, C3).

## Module rules lifted from the split history

Each of these is stated in a history section of the old `build/layers.md` and binds today (verbatim, with the ruling ids of its section).

- **Product modules from splits.** Each module a split or a new-module section created is a product module with no `from` (`from` names a legacy module only) (K624 (1), K617). A module taken from the catalogue is `from: legacy-checks`, moved, not copied (rule 3, K653 BOB-2).
- **publication family (K617, K651).** "Neither later module owns a table: each reads `publication`'s under its R40 and calls only its public services (R53–R55)." `corpus-export` "owns the table `export_log`" (K1024). `publish-schedule` owns `scheduled_editions` and "reaches the seam through a registration `publish-schedule` fills (K31's pattern)"; publication reaches its waiting editions through the registration `registerWaitingEditions` (K31's pattern; K2418).
- **Pure modules.** `case-grammar`, `inquiry-grammar` and `action-grammar` are pure; `op-declarations` is pure data (K651, K653 BOB-2, K624). `run-rules` is the AI run's rules "without a store" (K649 (1)). `site-profiles` "uses nothing"; `setup-words` "uses nothing, so every module may read words by key" (N1115, K3366 (4)). `record-grammar` "holds no store, no network and no clock" (K585 (4)). `case-checker` is "a pure function" (DEC-112).
- **Action grammar's write.** "Whether an action's write lands stays `actions`': its promotion step and acts call the grammar's functions and mint its rows." (K653 BOB-2.)
- **membership and credentials (K636 BOB-1, K653 BOB-2).** Membership "reaches sessions and keys only through R79's `onRevoked`, and reads the founder's claim through a registration"; credentials "reads `members` only through membership's services".
- **monitoring and link-sweep (N506, K1153, K1159).** `monitoring` provides the seam as stated services (its R65, R66), "so `monitoring` never imports a later module".
- **accepted-work (DEC-96 items 1, 4; N522).** "`inquiry`, `basis-versions`, `strength`, `reevaluation` and `publication` may not use" `case-import` (P4); `accepted-work` "declares the one registration `case-import` fills, the read facade those modules use, and the check that a leg on an imported finding names an edition whose acceptance is in force"; it has no table.
- **docket (DEC-116, DEC-100; N520, K1256, K1257).** "It sends nothing, and no entry is evidence." `reevaluation` (layer 7) "reads it only through the registration it offers (its R30)". Membership's `MODULE_ORDER` (its R83) is re-pinned to the new order whenever a module is added (T27, T28, T41).
- **steps and reading-guides (D27–D50, D8, D24, D65).** "A step is never evidence and writes no leg." "A guide says what to look for, never how the AI may behave." The step is on the question, not the project (D32, D35); the explorer stands apart "so steps, milestones and reports work fully without AI" (K2405, K2418).
