# Plan T53 · round R1, the beta's build

**Status** · written by BOB #326 from PLANNING L57's READY draft (K5569, K5570) and its detail files, with K5571-K5576. One round (K5567: no R3); each module's detail in `build/plan/T53-R1/<module>.md`: its rows of every input, verbatim. Entries here are cause ids and a short clause; their pointers (requirement ids, lane files) are in the rows file. Modules and layers follow `modules.json`.

**Legacy census** (§5.2 (2)): no module is legacy (`modules.json` carries no `from`; legacy-ui retired at T51, K4100).

**Reading an entry.** As T52-R1 (`archive/T52-R1.md`): `first: settle X`, `[waits: X]` (an act or measurement), `[owed: X]` (BOB's at writing, or a point settled at START), `after X` (a same-layer dependency arrives as a CHANGE, K5434 (2)); `T53-n` new, `C T52-n` carried (text in the rows file, from `carried-T52-R1.md`; T52-103 done, K5406). A job reads its module's rows file whole at START, and any lane draft an entry names whole, except one over 30 KB naming three or more modules: its head plus the module's sections. Layer 11's screen jobs also draw carried DEC-445, DEC-446, DEC-452 and DEC-453 rows (in their rows files). A DEC row is carried by id. K5565 English entries: the rule is in each rows file.

**Before R1 (BOB's acts).** (1), (2), (7), (8), (9) done (K5572, K5573). (3) Requirement lines from the READY drafts, numbered per CONSISTENCY §1. (4) PLATFORM's throwaway test T-a on a scratch copy (K5434 (1)), its figures to layer 11's START. (5) Design rows each entry names folded from `main` (K945). (6) CAPABILITIES' acts: M1 the `email()` probe on `20b5…7f72` only; M-R9 a member's own free CourtListener token by `request_credential`, never printed; record-core's two read-only checks on biosmoke8; N1265 rehearsal shapes on `CS_TEST_CF_ACCOUNT_ID` alone (K4942). (8) DEC-473 to DEC-478 merged; done. (10) U512-U518 (DEC-479 to DEC-485) merge with layer 3's first job, file-safety before doorbell. After K5576: BOB moves agent-runner after ai-gate when agent-worker's first entry merges.

## Measurements

K5567: at once unless it measures R1's code; scratch copies are BOB's under K5120, never biosmoke8. **At once, alongside R1:** registers M-R3 (index storage at 73,043 / 1M / 5M rows, decides S1-S4 before registers' START), M-R7 (streaming, sets `REGISTER_STREAM_MAX`, `SLICE_*` before register-readers' START), M-R4, M-R8, M-R10, M-R11, M-R12, the federal zips BOB's download; PLATFORM: Levels 2-3 study S1-S4 (N1271 waits, K5570), S1 baseline and soak on plat-s1, per-table bytes, P-M17 and FILES' L1-L6 on the alpha's reader, budget walks of today's screens, S2 prototypes B and C, Enterprise quote, load test's short "before" run, Level 1's figures; preparation: N1257's F4, N1268's corpus files, M-N1272's files and Bob's blind gold set (K5537), N824 P1-P2 with M1 and P3 once Bob's Email Routing domain exists (N1159). **After the code it measures** (on a scratch copy, when its module merges): M-N1272 after extraction (L4); interpretation timings and the per-level ceiling (R119, K5535) after extraction and investigation; N824's door CPU at 25 MiB after mail-reader and mail-door; N1268's walk after journey-check and the readers; the registers journey after registers and its screen; PLATFORM's fold, combined-read and work-fix figures after PL12-PL14, per-type load after the readers (L1), the N1273 picker and `eu` rehearsal after the installer, the whole-record move at 1, 5, 25 GB after corpus-export and the import, Institution after N1271; the load test per level (N1274) and budget walk L2, L3 after load-check and layer 11's deploy. **No R3:** a defect found goes to its module's job, open until its layer closes (P10); a closed layer's goes to the completion round.

## Left out of T53 (P19)

CAPABILITIES' (`plan-T53-capabilities.md` §E, each with its hard reason): webhooks (paid), OpenFEC (bulk needs no key), OpenCorporates (Bob: never), assisted register acts (Bob, after the alpha), company officers' bulk import until its line, Form 700 and unmeasured registers, the listing desk, payment probe (Bob, K5449 B1), Tier 2 texts, court-petition templates (Bob: never), interpreting everything (K5445), K5458's unlisted names (outside its list). K5424 `noindex` stays until the 1.0 release is deployed (Bob, K5526). K5447 (B) over-limit partial read waits until proposals work well (K5445). N1270 audio, video, forum formats after 1.0 (Bob, K4628; held and named, K5436). K5454 Enterprise support: built with the first team that wants it, listed "not yet available" (PL29). FILES Tier 3 readers (PST/OST, Access): each by Bob's ruling when a real file is shown (K5437). N1267a XLSX by window: Bob has not decided; the beta keeps 250,000 cells (K4831 (10)).
