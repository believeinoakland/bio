# office-readers — requirements

**Status** · In force: written by BOB #37 (T6), a helper module, its requirements BOB's (K20). Last changed T36 (T36-3: R11 amended, a `.docx` table's cells; K1972); every requirement met (OFFICE-READERS #7, K2078). Last changed T51 (T51-6: R34 new, a document's own title in `metadata`; N1202; K3627); marked not yet met (T51). Last changed T51 (csv split: the csv entry, its dialect, typed cells, large-text arm and the sheet-cell/sheet-range builders moved to `csv-reader`; K624, K531, K617, K3268, K4523); R11's csv bound note moved with it. Fix round 6 (T51): R11 amended, the xlsx entry's sheets carry `lineRows` (G15; K4579). Fix round 9 (T51; G124c, G125d, G128e, G131e, G131g, G133c, G133d, G134; K4831 (7), K4834, K4837): R12, R30, R37 amended (the figures from the table; dates typed, reversing R30's rule; a point read bounded by a window), R36 and R37 moved to Provides, R38-R45 new (every part kind a unit, character references, the one decode, a linear walk, streamed digests, retained objects, omitted table cells); marked not yet met (T51).

## Public

### Purpose

Reads DOCX, PPTX and XLSX bytes into `format-registry`'s I7 entry contract:
detection, the I2 structure shape (links with IC-1 element references, and the DEC-5
evidentiary envelope) and the I2 text shape. It also exports the per-container
element-reference builders that `odf-reader` reuses so its OpenDocument entries emit
byte-identical reference shapes for the same kinds. It holds no record, reads nothing
beyond the bytes it is handed, and writes nothing. CSV is `csv-reader`'s; `csv.mjs` stays here only as a one-line re-export of its entry (K3268).

### Provides

Three registry entries, each the shape `format-registry` requires: `format` (a string),
`detect(bytes, contentType)`, `parts(bytes)`, `structure(partsOrBytes)`, `text(partsOrBytes)`. `structure` and `text` accept either raw bytes or
`parts()`'s own output, so a caller that already paid for `parts()` does not pay twice.

#### Detection

- **R1** Each entry's `format` is `"docx"`, `"pptx"` or `"xlsx"` (csv: moved to csv-reader R1).
- **R2** `docxEntry`, `pptxEntry`, `xlsxEntry`: `detect(bytes, null)` returns `null` when
  `bytes` has no ZIP local-file-header magic, or has the magic but no readable central
  directory (the acquire-time 1 KiB prefix seam — a bare `PK\x03\x04` sniff never claims
  one of these formats). With a readable central directory that names both
  `[Content_Types].xml` and the format's own main part (`word/document.xml`,
  `ppt/presentation.xml`, `xl/workbook.xml`), it returns
  `{format, confidence:"likely", signals}` — never `"certain"`: the OPC declared content
  type is a deflated part, out of a synchronous detect's reach. `detect(null, contentType)`
  returns `{format, confidence:"likely", signals}` when `contentType` exactly equals the
  format's registered content type (`DOCX_CONTENT_TYPE`, `PPTX_CONTENT_TYPE`,
  `XLSX_CONTENT_TYPE`), else `null`.
- **R3** *(retired: moved to csv-reader R2, K4523)*

#### `parts()`

- **R4** `docxEntry.parts`/`pptxEntry.parts`: an unreadable main part (`word/document.xml`,
  `ppt/presentation.xml`) does not fail the read. `parts().ok` stays `true`; the main part's
  text is `null`, and the failure is carried in `parts().undetermined` (docx) or as a note
  plus unnumbered slides (pptx, `order: null`). `parts()` returns `{ok:false, why, signals}`
  only when the bytes are not discriminated as the entry's own format or the ZIP container
  itself cannot be read.
- **R5** `xlsxEntry.parts`: an unreadable `xl/workbook.xml` fails the whole read —
  `{ok:false, why:"workbook_unreadable:<reason>"}` — because sheet names, order and hidden
  state all come from it and nothing downstream can proceed without it. Any other part
  (a sheet, `sharedStrings.xml`, `docProps/core.xml`) failing is carried in `undetermined`
  while `ok` stays `true`.
- **R6** *(retired: moved to csv-reader R3, K4523)*

#### `structure()` — the I2 shape

Every entry's `structure()` returns `{ok, container:"docx"|"pptx"|"xlsx", links,
counts:{anchor,intra,deferred,refused,undetermined}, evidentiary, notes[]}` plus one
format-specific unit-count field (`paragraphs` for docx, `slides` for pptx, `sheets` for
xlsx), or `{ok:false, container, reason}` when `parts` failed. csv's `structure()` is csv-reader R4.

- **R7** Each `links[]` entry is `{partition, wrapper, target, source}`. `partition` is
  `"deferred"` (http/https or a bare relative target) or `"refused"` (every other URI
  scheme) for an outbound relationship — classified and wrapped through
  `subresources.linkWrapper`, never re-derived; `"anchor"` for an internal reference that
  resolves (a DOCX bookmark, an XLSX defined name or cross-sheet reference, a PPTX
  same-deck slide jump); `"intra"` for an embedded part, content-addressed by its sha256;
  `"undetermined"` for a reference this entry could not resolve, carrying why. `source` is
  the element reference (below) of where in the document the link was found, or `null` for
  a document-level fact with no single location (a defined name, an unused rel, an
  embedding no usage was found for). An unreadable `.rels` part yields an `undetermined`
  link stating links MAY be missing — never counted as zero.
- **R8** Element references (IC-1), each produced ONLY by this module (§ Reference
  builders): `docx` sources are `docParaRef`; `pptx` sources are `slideShapeRef`, with
  slide numbers taken from the deck's own declared order
  (`ppt/presentation.xml`'s `sldIdLst`, resolved through its `.rels`) and NEVER from
  `slideN.xml` filenames, which record creation order; when that order cannot be read,
  affected slides and their sources are `null` (never numbered off the filename); `xlsx`
  sources are `sheetCellRef`.
- **R9** `xlsxEntry.structure`: each workbook `definedName` (multi-area ones included) in
  `xl/workbook.xml` emits one `anchor` link with `source:null` and
  `target:{definedName, ref, fragment:"#<ref>"}`. `xlsxEntry.text()` also carries, over the size
  guard too, `rangeUnits: [{source:"defined-name"|"table", name, scope, hidden, unit}]`, one per
  defined name or table part (reached through each sheet's own `.rels`) that is ONE rectangle on
  ONE sheet of this workbook, `unit` being its `sheet-range` reference from the one builder; and
  `rangeUnitsSkipped: [{source, name, ref, why, part?}]` for every other, `why` one of
  `multi_area`, `broken_reference`, `not_a_range_reference`, `whole_row_or_column`,
  `external_workbook`, `multi_sheet_reference`, `no_such_sheet`, `outside_grid`,
  `empty_reference`, `table_part_unreadable:<why>`, `table_element_absent`.
- **R10** The DEC-5 evidentiary envelope, `evidentiary:{container, kinds, items,
  undetermined, counts}`, is the SAME shape across the three entries here (csv-reader R4 states csv's):
  - `docx`: `{kind:"tracked-change", change:"insertion"|"deletion", author, date, text
    (insertion) | superseded (deletion), source}` per `<w:ins>`/`<w:del>`; `{kind:"comment",
    id, author, date, initials, text, source}` per `word/comments.xml` entry;
    `{kind:"core-properties", creator, lastModifiedBy, revision, revisionNumber, created,
    modified, title, source:null}` when `docProps/core.xml` is present and readable.
  - `pptx`: `{kind:"hidden-slide", slide, part, source}` for a slide part whose bytes
    declare `show="0"|"false"` on either the slide's own `<p:sld>` root or its `sldIdLst`
    entry (an absent attribute means shown; nothing is guessed) — the slide's text, notes
    and links are still fully extracted elsewhere, never omitted for being hidden;
    `{kind:"speaker-notes", slide, part, text, source}` per `notesSlide` part, mapped to its
    slide through the slide's OWN `.rels` (never the filename convention); an orphan
    `notesSlide` no slide's rels claims still carries its evidence with `slide:null,
    source:null`; `{kind:"core-properties", ...}` as docx.
  - `xlsx`: `{kind:"formula", source, formula, value}` per cell carrying `<f>` — `value` is
    the cell's cached `<v>` (`null` when the file carries none, never invented), held
    BESIDE `formula`, never substituted for it; `{kind:"hidden-rows", sheet, rows, count,
    source:null}` and `{kind:"hidden-cols", sheet, cols:[{min,max}], count, source:null}`
    per sheet that has any; `{kind:"hidden-sheet", sheet, state, source:null}` per sheet
    whose `state` is `"hidden"` or `"veryHidden"` (read from the small `workbook.xml`, so
    this item is emitted even when the sheet's own part is over the size guard);
    `{kind:"core-properties", ...}` as docx.
  - `csv`: moved to csv-reader R4.

#### `text()` — the I2 text shape

- **R11** Each entry's `text()` returns `{ok, container, document, undetermined, (T51 fix round 6, G15; K4579; amends R11) The xlsx entry's `text()` also carries, on each sheet, `lineRows`: one 1-based row number per line of the sheet's `text`, the same length, in the order of the lines (file order); a row with no readable `r` follows the row before it, and an empty sheet carries `[]`; absent (unknown) when the sheet could not be read. Test: `line-rows.test.mjs`: rows out of order, an empty row, an empty-string row, a styled empty cell and a row with no `r`.
  counts, images}` plus a format-specific per-unit list, or `{ok:false, container, reason}`
  when `parts` failed. `images` (docx/pptx/xlsx) is every image under the format's own
  media directory (`word/media/`, `ppt/media/`, `xl/media/`), content-addressed and
  exhaustive, or `null` when it could not be walked.
  - `docx`: `document` is `<w:t>` text joined per paragraph, newline-joined across
    paragraphs; `w:delText` (deleted text) is NEVER in it — it lives only in the
    evidentiary `superseded` field; `w:ins` (inserted text) IS in it. `paragraphs` is
    `[{para, ref, text}]`, one per `<w:p>` read, in document order (including inside tables); in each `mc:AlternateContent` (ECMA-376 Part 3) only the first `mc:Choice` is read, or the `mc:Fallback` when there is no `mc:Choice`, nested ones alike, and a branch not selected is not read (no paragraph, run, text, hyperlink, tracked change, bookmark, comment reference or table of it; N26, K747).
    `tables` is `[{table, ref, rows, cols}]` for every `<w:tbl>` in document order
    (nested included), or `null` when the body was not read (never confused with the empty
    list, which means a body with no tables). (N724; K1972) Each table also carries `cells`,
    held as R30 holds a sheet's: `[{source, value, type, declared, cached, formula}]`, one per
    cell holding text, in row then column order over the table's own grid; `source` is the
    cell's `doc-table` reference with its `cell` (R16); `value` is the cell's text as this
    walk reads it into `document` (its paragraphs newline-joined, `w:delText` never, `w:ins`
    in); `type` is always `text` and `declared`, `cached` and `formula` are `null` (a Word
    table declares no cell type, so no date or number is inferred). A nested table's cells are
    its own table's. (N758; K2118) Each cell also carries `paras`: the `para` ordinals
    (of `paragraphs`) of the paragraphs its text was read from, in reading order, so a reader
    finds a cell's paragraphs exactly, a vertically merged cell's included, without matching
    lines.
  - `pptx`: `document` is slide text only, newline-joined, in deck order — speaker notes
    are NEVER in it. `slides` is `[{slide, ref, part, hidden, shapes, text}]`, one per deck
    entry; a hidden slide's `text` IS populated and its `hidden` is `true` (DEC-5: the
    record holds what the file holds). `speakerNotes` is a DISTINCT list,
    `[{slide, ref:"slide <n> (notes)", part, hidden, text}]`, never merged into `slides`.
    `deckLength` is the number of `<p:sldId>` slots the bytes declare (an unresolvable slot
    still counts), or `null` when the declared order cannot be read — never counted off the
    slide parts present, which would under-report a deck with unreadable trailing slides.
    In each slide's and each notes slide's `mc:AlternateContent` only the first `mc:Choice` is read, or the
    `mc:Fallback` when there is no `mc:Choice`, nested ones alike; a branch not selected is
    not read, so its text is not in `text` or `document` and its shapes take no `shape` index
    (nor do the `hlinks` and `ridUsage` they would carry). Slide numbers and the slide unit do
    not move (N439, K747, K863).
  - `xlsx`: `document` is every sheet's text, tab-joined per row, newline-joined across
    rows and sheets. `sheets` is `[{sheet, name, hidden, rows, cols, usedRows, usedCols,
    range, text, undetermined}]`. `rows`/`cols` are the FIXED format bound
    (1,048,576 / 16,384) — never the used range, so that an address the format cannot hold
    is refused while an empty-but-addressable cell is not. `usedRows`/`usedCols` are the
    furthest CELL (not styled row) this walk actually saw, and `range` is the
    `usedSheetRange` unit derived from them, or `null` for an empty/unmeasured sheet. A
    `t="s"` cell whose shared-string index cannot be resolved is a stated `undetermined`,
    never an invented string.
  - `csv`: moved to csv-reader R5.

#### The size guard

- **R12** `docxEntry`/`pptxEntry`/`xlsxEntry`: before reading any text part, the DECLARED
  UNCOMPRESSED bytes of the parts that would be inflated for text (docx:
  `word/document.xml` + `word/comments.xml`; pptx: every `ppt/slides/*.xml` +
  `ppt/notesSlides/*.xml`; xlsx: every worksheet part + `xl/sharedStrings.xml`) are summed
  from the ZIP central directory, BEFORE any inflation. Over `MEASURED_OOXML_TEXT_BOUND_BYTES`
  (20 MiB, the table's figure, R35), text extraction is refused: `text()` returns `document:null` and the guard's own
  marker verbatim in `undetermined`, never a silent truncation, and `structure()` skips only
  the parts that needed inflating — the container walk, rels, and any part read directly
  from the small central-directory-adjacent metadata (docx: none extra; pptx:
  `ppt/presentation.xml`, so slide numbering survives; xlsx: `xl/workbook.xml`, so sheet
  names/order/hidden state survive) still run and are reported.
  The guard counts every part read, not only text parts (F18; K1881): every part these
  entries inflate (text parts, images, R11; embedded parts, R7; `.rels` parts, the core
  properties, the VBA project, R32) is read through `ooxml`'s part cap (its R31), so a part
  whose declared size exceeds `MEMBER_MAX`, or any part of a file whose declared total
  exceeds `ARCHIVE_TOTAL_MAX`, is never inflated, and what needed it is stated by the
  limit's name where that part's failure is stated today (an `undetermined` link or entry,
  `images:null` with `imagesWhy`, an `active` item with `read:false`), never omitted
  silently.

#### `dialect()` (csv only; moved)

- **R14** *(retired: moved to csv-reader R7, K4523)*

### Reference builders (reused by `odf-reader`)

Exported so `odf-reader`'s three OpenDocument entries emit references in the IDENTICAL
shape these entries do for the equivalent OOXML container — one builder per arm, never a
second copy that could drift.

- **R15** `docParaRef(para, run=null) -> {kind:"doc-para", ref:"¶<para+1>", para[, run]}`.
  `para` and `run` are 0-based; `run` is included only when given — a reference genuinely
  targeting a run (a hyperlink, a tracked change), never a default.
- **R16** `docTableRef(table, cell=null) -> {kind:"doc-table", ref:"table <table+1>[, <cell>]",
  table[, cell]}`. `table` is the table's 0-based ordinal in document order (nested tables
  included, counted as they open; a table in an `mc:AlternateContent` branch not read, R11, is not counted); `cell` is A1 notation over the table's own grid,
  included only when given.
- **R17** *(retired: moved to csv-reader R10; `formats-xlsx.mjs` re-exports `sheetCellRef`, K4523)*
- **R18** *(retired: moved to csv-reader R11; `formats-xlsx.mjs` re-exports `usedSheetRange`, K4523)*
- **R19** `slideShapeRef(slide, shape=null) -> {kind:"slide-shape", ref:"slide <slide>",
  slide[, shape]}`. `slide` is 1-based and equal to the number in `ref`; `shape` is the
  0-based shape-sequence index, included only when the reference genuinely targets a shape.

**Range units (reused by `odf-reader`; N27, K279)**

- **R26** `a1Corner(s) -> {col, row} | null`. One A1 corner, both 1-based: one to three letters (read without case; bijective base 26, `A`=1, `ZZZ`=18278), then a row 1–9,999,999 with no leading zero; either `$` marker allowed and ignored; surrounding whitespace trimmed. `null` for anything else: a non-string, a whole row or column, a range, a sheet-qualified reference, row 0. Never throws.
- **R27** `rangeUnitFor(sheetName, a, b, sheets, grid = null) -> {unit} | {why}`. `a`, `b`: corners as R26 returns them, in any order; `sheets`: the workbook's sheet names; `grid`: the format's bound `{rows, cols}`, or `null` when the format fixes none. `unit` is the `sheet-range` reference (csv-reader R11's shape and builder) of the rectangle, top-left corner first. The sheet matches exactly, else without case when exactly one sheet answers; the unit carries the workbook's spelling. `why`: `not_a_range_reference` (a corner is not `{col, row}` of positive integers), `no_such_sheet` (no sheet answers, two answer without case, or `sheetName`/`sheets` is not a string/array), `outside_grid` (either corner past `grid` on either axis). Never throws. R9's units are built through it.

- **R28** `docxRenumbering(documentXml) -> {paragraphs:[{old, new, outer}], runs:[{old, new, outer}], tables:[{old, new}]}`: for a stored docx reading made before N26, every `<w:p>`, `<w:r>` and `<w:tbl>` as the pre-N26 walk numbered it (`old`, 0-based, every branch of `mc:AlternateContent` counted), its index under R11 and R16 (`new`), `null` for one inside a branch not read, with `outer` the new index of the paragraph that holds that `mc:AlternateContent`. Used only by extraction's migration of stored ¶ and table references (N26, layer 4); retired once that migration has run (K747).
- **R29** `pptxRenumbering(parts) -> {slides:[{slide, shapes:[{old, new}]}]} | null`: `parts` is `pptxEntry.parts(bytes)`'s own result, read synchronously as R28; `null` unless it is `ok`. For a stored pptx reading made before N439, one entry per slide part the reading walked, in deck order and numbered as the reading numbers slides (a slide whose part could not be read is not listed), every shape as the pre-N439 walk numbered it (`old`, 0-based, every branch of `mc:AlternateContent` counted) and its index under R11's pptx arm (`new`), `null` for a shape inside a branch not read. Used only by extraction's migration of stored `slide-shape` references (layer 4); retired once that migration has run, as R28 (K795 (6), K863).

#### Typed cells and office metadata (T33-10)

- **R30** (C:A-3; K1448) `xlsxEntry.text()` gives each sheet a `cells` list, `[{source, value, type, declared, cached, formula}]`, one per cell holding a value or a formula, in row then column order. `source` is the cell's `sheet-cell` reference (R17). `value` is the cell's stored lexical value exactly as the file holds it (xlsx `<v>`, an inline string's text, or a resolved shared string), never re-rendered through a binary float, so `0.1` stays `"0.1"`. `type` is one of `number`, `text`, `boolean`, `date`, `time`, `error` (`time` given by `odf-reader` alone), read only from what the file declares (xlsx `t`: absent or `n` number, `s`, `str` and `inlineStr` text, `b` boolean, `d` date, `e` error); a date implied only by a cell's style is not inferred. *(Replaced by the fix round 9 rule at the end of this requirement.)* `declared` is the format's own type token as written. For a cell carrying `<f>`, `formula` is its text and `cached` its cached `<v>` (`null` when the file carries none), the same pair R10's `formula` item holds; otherwise both are `null`. Nothing is recalculated (R10's rule: a cached value is the file's statement, never this module's computation). A cell whose shared string cannot be resolved keeps its entry with `value: null` and stays in `undetermined`. Over the size guard (R12) `cells` is `null`, never `[]`. `cells` is the contract `odf-reader` R46 gives `.ods` sheets, field for field (`serial` below excepted). csv's cells: csv-reader R8.
  **Dates typed (fix round 9, G134c; S-11; K4831 (7); reverses the rule above, Bob told).** A cell whose number format, read from the file's `styles.xml` (the built-in date and date-time format numbers and the custom formats that carry date tokens), is a date or date-time format is `type: "date"` although the file declares no date type. Its `value` is the date as ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`, with `THH:MM:SS` when the stored number has a time part), computed under the workbook's own date system (1900, or 1904 when the workbook declares it); `serial` is the stored lexical value as the file holds it (`<v>`, `"45413"`), kept beside; `declared` is unchanged. The sheet's `text` and `document` show the ISO date for such a cell, so `2024-05-01` is found in an XLSX as it is in a CSV and an ODS. A cell whose number is outside the dates its system can express, or whose format carries only a time, stays `number` with its lexical value; a `t="d"` cell is already ISO and keeps its value with no `serial`. A cell that is not a typed date has no `serial` key.
- **R31** (B §(d) EVENTS 3; K1505 (11)) `docxEntry.text()`, `pptxEntry.text()` and `xlsxEntry.text()` also carry `metadata`: `{author, lastModifiedBy, created, modified, source: "docProps/core.xml"}`, the core-properties item's `creator`, `lastModifiedBy`, `created` and `modified` (R10) exactly as the part writes them (W3CDTF strings unchanged), each `null` when absent; `metadata` is `null` when there is no readable core part, and the reason is in `undetermined`. It is what the file states about itself, the one source `content` hands `events` for an edit act's author and dates; this module asserts no act (R24). csv's `metadata` is csv-reader R8's.

#### Active content (T35-9)

- **R32** (K1888) `docxEntry`, `pptxEntry` and `xlsxEntry`: `structure()` and `text()` both
  carry `active`, the same list from one builder: every part of the file that can act when
  it is opened, found and read, never run. csv's `active` is csv-reader R8's. One item per finding, in central-directory order of its `part`, and within
  one `.rels` part in that part's order:
  - `{kind:"vba-project", part, read, why, project, modules, autoRun, suspicious, undetermined}` for each
    member whose name's last segment is `vbaProject.bin` (without regard to case), read
    through `ooxml.readVbaProject` (its R32): `modules` the module names, `autoRun` and
    `suspicious` its lists against `ooxml`'s tables, and `undetermined` ooxml's `[{module, why}]` for
    each module whose source it could not read (`[]` when none; K1916), so a partial read never reads as
    complete; when that read refuses, `read:false`, `why` its refusal, the other fields `null`, the item
    still listed. A part under a `_rels/` directory is never an `activex`, `ole-object` or
    `embedded-file` item (it yields its own `external-target` items).
  - `{kind:"activex", part}` for each member under the format's own `activeX/` directory
    (`word/activeX/`, `ppt/activeX/`, `xl/activeX/`).
  - `{kind:"ole-object", part}` for each member under the format's own `embeddings/`
    directory whose name's last segment begins `oleObject` (without regard to case).
  - `{kind:"embedded-file", part}` for every other member under that `embeddings/`
    directory (the parts R7's `intra` links name).
  - `{kind:"external-target", part, type, target}` for every external relationship
    (`ooxml` R16's `external`) whose type is not the hyperlink type
    (`…/relationships/hyperlink`, which R7's `links` already carry): `part` the `.rels`
    part holding it, `type` and `target` as written.
  - `{kind:"xl4-macrosheet", part}` (xlsx, K1903) for each member under `xl/macrosheets/`
    (an Excel 4.0 macro sheet).
  - `{kind:"unread", part, why}` for a `.rels` part `ooxml.walkRels` could not read or
    parse (its `undetermined`): the list MAY be missing items, stated, never read as none.
  `active` is `[]` only when nothing was found and nothing went unread. It reads names
  from the central directory, the `.rels` parts and the VBA project, so it is carried in
  full over the text size guard (R12). This module asserts no threat (R24): an item says
  the file can act, not that it is malicious.

- **R33** (K1888, K1903) The macro-enabled flavours are read as their plain twins
  (`ooxml` R10): `docxEntry` reads `.docm` and `.dotm`, `xlsxEntry` `.xlsm`, `.xltm` and
  `.xlam`, `pptxEntry` `.pptm`, `.potm`, `.ppsm` and `.ppam`, through the same `parts()`,
  `structure()` and `text()` with every requirement above unchanged; R4's "discriminated as
  the entry's own format" holds for a twin's `variant` as for the plain row. Their
  `structure()` and `text()` answers carry `variant` (`ooxml.discriminate`'s, e.g.
  `"docm"`; `null` for a plain file), and their `active` (R32) lists the VBA
  project. `detect(null, contentType)` also answers `{format, confidence:"likely",
  signals}` for each twin's package content type (`application/vnd.ms-word.document.macroEnabled.12`,
  `application/vnd.ms-word.template.macroEnabled.12`, `application/vnd.ms-excel.sheet.macroEnabled.12`,
  `application/vnd.ms-excel.template.macroEnabled.12`, `application/vnd.ms-excel.addin.macroEnabled.12`,
  `application/vnd.ms-powerpoint.presentation.macroEnabled.12`,
  `application/vnd.ms-powerpoint.template.macroEnabled.12`,
  `application/vnd.ms-powerpoint.slideshow.macroEnabled.12`,
  `application/vnd.ms-powerpoint.addin.macroEnabled.12`), with `format` the twin's.
 

- **R34** (T51; N1202; K3627; amends R31) `docxEntry.text()` and `pptxEntry.text()` also carry in `metadata` the key `title`: the core part's `title` (`dc:title`) exactly as the part writes it, so `reading-pipeline` R34 titles the reading from it and the record's lists name the document. When the core part states no title, or one that is empty or only whitespace, `metadata` has no `title` key at all (never `null`, never an invented title, never the file name or a heading of the body); when there is no readable core part, `metadata` is `null` as R31 says and has no title. R31's other keys are unchanged. Test: a docx and a pptx whose `docProps/core.xml` states a title give it in `metadata.title`; control: a core part with no `title` element, with an empty one and with a whitespace-only one gives `metadata` with no `title` key; a file with no core part gives `metadata: null`.

- **R35** (fix round 4b, F7; K4487, K4504; ooxml R35; amends R11, R12, R30) **Large text is read in pieces.** Text over `MEASURED_OOXML_TEXT_BOUND_BYTES` up to ooxml's ceiling is read in pieces by `text()` and `structure()`: xlsx a run of whole rows at a time, docx by the two body walks fed in pieces, pptx a part at a time. The answer is what a small file's would be, except that no typed `cells` are made (`sheets[].cells` and docx `tables[].cells` are `null`), `text()` carries `piecewise` (ooxml `textPlan`'s) and `structure()` notes `text_read_in_pieces`. Over the ceiling the marker is `textPlan`'s `guard`, `final: true`. A part that cannot be read in pieces or is itself over the bound (an xlsx sheet or docx body with no cut in 8 MiB, a pptx slide or notes part, a docx comments part over 20 MiB) is stated `over_size_bound` with `size` and `final: true` (`detail: "piece_unbounded"` where no cut was found) where that part's failure is stated; a part whose CRC or length fails gives no text of it, only the reason. Test: `large-text.test.mjs` (30 MB xlsx, docx, pptx, real packages; read in a worker of 128 MB old space). csv's arm: csv-reader R9.

- **R36** (G41; K4636, K4639, K4642; amends R30, R35, R11's xlsx arm) `xlsxEntry.text(partsOrBytes, opts)` takes an optional `opts.inlineCellsMax`, a number of bytes (the caller's figure; reading-pipeline's 512 KiB, K4646). With it a sheet's `cells` are listed only while the cells of all the workbook's sheets together, as JSON in UTF-8 bytes, are within it; past it every sheet the read walked has `cells: null` and `cells_held: true`, and nothing else about the sheet changes (its text, `lineRows`, extent, counts and `undetermined` are what the whole read gives); over the whole-read bound (R35) `cells` is null and `cells_held` true too. Without the option, or with one that is not a number of at least 0, every cell is listed as R30 says and `cells_held` is never present. A sheet that could not be read has `cells: null` and no `cells_held`. A cell whose declared type is outside the format's list is stated in `undetermined` (`cell_type_unknown`) whether the cells are listed, held or read in pieces. Test: `g41-held.test.mjs`.
- **R37** (G41; K4636, K4642, K4647) `xlsxEntry.cellsIn(partsOrBytes, {sheet, fromRow, toRow, fromCol, toCol, maxCells})`, an optional slot of the entry (as `dialect` is, format-registry R? unchanged), answers `{ok:true, sheet, cells, rows:{from,to}, next_row?, undetermined}`: the typed cells (R30's shape, made by the same code) of the named sheet (its name, else without case when one answers, or its 0-based position) in rows `fromRow` to `toRow` (to the end of the sheet when absent) and columns `fromCol` to `toCol`, in row then column order, equal to what the whole read lists for them, hidden rows and columns included (R23). A call answers whole rows, at most `maxCells` cells (default 20,000, `CELLS_IN_MAX`; the first row whole if alone it is over); the row that would pass it is left, `next_row` is its number (null when nothing in range remains) and `rows.to` the last row answered. `undetermined` states each cell of the range whose type is outside the list or whose shared string cannot be resolved. The sheet part is inflated in windows and only the rows in range are parsed, rows being taken ascending as the format requires. (Fix round 9, G131e; S-20) A point read does not inflate and CRC-check the whole sheet part on every call: it works from access points the whole read left in the reading, and the bytes it serves for a call at row 700,000 are bounded by the rows asked for and one window, not by the sheet's size or the row's offset. A refusal is `{ok:false, reason}`: `invalid_argument` (with `argument`), `no_such_sheet`, `over_size_bound` (over the streamed ceiling, with `size`, `bound`, `final`), `sheet_unreadable`, or the part's own reason (`crc_mismatch`, `size_mismatch`, ...); it never throws. The shared strings stay one list held whole and the zip's central directory stays whole, both bounded by R12's declared-text guard and the 32 MiB ceiling (ooxml R35), which is what G41 proves; ods, docx and pptx tables keep their cells in the reading (`odf-reader` and `docx.mjs` unchanged; above 1 MiB of reading they meet extraction's guard and are stated refused). Test: `g41-held.test.mjs`. `next_row` is absent when nothing in range remains; rows and columns 1-based and inclusive (K4647).

- **R38** (fix round 9, G134a, G134d; X11; K4831 (7)) **Every part of a document is a unit with its kind.** `docxEntry.text()`, `pptxEntry.text()` and `xlsxEntry.text()` carry `parts`: `[{kind, ref, part, text, hidden?}]`, one per piece of text in the file outside the body's own units, in document order, `ref` the element reference of where it sits (R15-R19, `sheetCellRef` for a sheet note) and `part` the package part it came from. `kind` is one of the closed list `body`, `footnote`, `endnote`, `header`, `footer`, `comment`, `tracked_deletion`, `text_box`, `speaker_note`, `master_text`, `cell_note`: docx footnotes, endnotes, headers, footers, comments, tracked deletions (their deleted text, which stays out of `document`, R11) and text boxes; pptx speaker notes, slide-master and layout text and text boxes, a hidden slide's text marked `hidden: true`; xlsx cell comments (`cell_note`). `document` stays the body's text and the lists R11 describes are unchanged: `parts` adds, never replaces. Text the file holds that is in no unit is a stated `undetermined`, never a reading that says it is whole. Since K4924: each part's `ref` is a non-empty STRING that addresses that piece alone within its `part` (reading-pipeline R47 keeps a `ref` only when it is a string, text-chain R97's `doc-part` arm addresses by `part` and `ref`): a footnote, endnote or comment by its own id (`footnote <id>`, `endnote <id>`, `comment <id>`), a header or footer by its part, a tracked deletion, text box or speaker note by its anchor's reference written as a string (R15-R19's `ref` text) with a run or ordinal where two share it; the anchor's element reference, where it has one, stays beside it as `anchor` (R15-R19's object). No two pieces of one document share (`part`, `ref`). **Amended (fix round 9, G166; K4985):** a text box's words are a piece of kind `text_box` only: the `text_box` part names the paragraphs it holds (`paras`, their indices in the body's `paragraphs`), and those paragraphs are not also body text, so a search finds the box's words once, as `text_box`. Test: a DOCX whose body holds a text box: its words come back as one `text_box` piece and no `body` paragraph (control-plane seam §10). The same holds for a PowerPoint text box whose words a slide's shape text already carries (pptx): one unit, of one kind (K4987). Control: a paragraph outside any box stays body.
- **R39** (fix round 9, G134a) A DOCX or PPTX whose only content in a place is a picture lists the picture (R11's `images`) and states it unread in `undetermined` (`image_unread`, with its `ref`); this module calls no OCR, and the marker is what the pipeline owes OCR for.
- **R40** (fix round 9, G133c; X12, S-21) A numeric character reference that names no Unicode scalar value (above U+10FFFF, a surrogate, U+0000, digits that do not parse) never makes a read throw, in the body or in any part: the part holding it is stated unreadable in `undetermined` (`{part, why:"char_ref_invalid", final:true}`), the same on every call, and the rest of the document is read.
- **R41** (fix round 9, G131g; X9; K4628 reversed) Every text part (`word/document.xml`, a notes, comments, header or footer part, a slide, a sheet, shared strings) is decoded through ooxml's `decodeText` (its R36), so a UTF-16 part is read and not found empty; text inside `<![CDATA[ ]]>` in `<w:t>` and its sibling text elements is read; a part decoded with more than 0.5 % replacement characters is stated `partial` in `undetermined` with the count.
- **R42** (fix round 9, G133d; X6) **Reading a part costs work linear in its size.** The scan of a docx, pptx or xlsx part examines each byte a bounded number of times: `counts.scanned_bytes` is at most 4 times the part's bytes, whatever its shape (an unterminated tag, 40,000 copies of `<a b="`, 20,000 unclosed `<w:comment `, 200,000 `<!x>`). A tag longer than 64 KiB is not a tag: its bytes are text and it is stated in `undetermined` (`tag_over_bound`). `text(partsOrBytes, {yieldNow})` and `structure()` await `yieldNow()` at least every 65,536 tokens when it is a function; the answer is the same without it.
- **R43** (fix round 9, G125d; X7) An embedded part's or an image's identity (`part`, the sha256) is taken as the member streams through ooxml's `streamMember`, never from the member held whole: the largest buffer held for it is one read window and one inflate chunk, and a member over ooxml's `MEMBER_MAX` or `ARCHIVE_RATIO_MAX` (its R31) is refused before inflation and stated by that name where R12 states a refused part.
- **R44** (fix round 9, G124c; X2) **What the walk retains is bounded before the walk.** A docx, pptx or xlsx whose body would retain more than the table's office retained-objects figure (250,000 paragraphs, cells and links together) or more decoded characters at once than the table's decoded-characters row is refused before the walk, by name and with its figure: `undetermined` carries `{why:"TOO_MANY_OBJECTS", n, bound, final:true}` (`n` the count reached) or the decoded-characters equivalent, `document` is `null`, and nothing else is read from the body. Both figures are `READ_BOUNDS` rows taken through `boundOf`; the job proposes the decoded-characters figure from its capped child and BOB records it. The shapes the bound answers are one-cell tables, empty paragraphs, hundreds of thousands of tiny paragraphs, hyperlinks and nested tables at equal bytes.
- **R45** (fix round 9, G128e; N22) Past `opts.inlineCellsMax` (reading-pipeline's 512 KiB), the cells of a docx table (R11) and of a pptx table are omitted: `tables[].cells` is `null` with `cells_omitted: true` and the statement in `undetermined`; the paragraphs and `document` still carry every cell's text, so the document stays indexed and searchable to its last cell. A held form of those cells is Stage 3's.
- **R46** (fix round 9, G178; K5006) **A workbook is read within its memory with room to spare.** `xlsxEntry.text()` over a workbook within its bound peaks at most 85 % of the object's cap (`capFor`, runtime-limits): a sheet's text and the document's are not built while the unpacked parts and shared strings they came from are still all held. Test: the shape harness's 150,000-row xlsx (`g41-shape`) peaks at most 85 % of `capFor(128)`, and survives five runs with its process pinned to one core beside three CPU burners. Control: a small workbook answers the same text as before. *(not yet met: T51)*
- **R47** (fix round 9, G185; K5011; S-15-S-18) **XLSX cells as the file states.** A shared formula's dependents carry their own formula text; a row or cell with no `r` is placed by its position; a styled empty cell does not extend the used range (office R11); `mergeCells` is read and a covered cell stated as covered. Test: each case. *(not yet met: T51)*
- **R48** (fix round 9, G186; K5020; CORPUS #1's F1) **A workbook whose rows and cells carry no `r` is read whole.** The `r` attributes of a row and a cell are optional: a sheet that omits them takes its rows and columns from the order the file states them (each row the one after the last, each cell the column after the last), so its used range, its `sheet-range` unit and its cells are what a referenced copy of the same sheet gives, never a null range or an empty reading. Test: plane's `g124f-bounds.test.mjs` "G124f finding F1" (1,000 narrow rows with no `r`), C07 and C08 (1,048,576 and 1,048,577 rows) read through the reading as a referenced copy reads, or refused with size and limit as R46's bound states. *(not yet met: T51)*

Errors: none of R1–R45 ever throws. A precondition this module cannot verify (bytes that
are not this format, a value `recognise`-style helpers were not asked to check) is answered
as a stated `undetermined`/`ok:false`, never an exception and never a guess.

## Private

### Uses

- `subresources`: `linkWrapper` (`.deferred`, `.refused`, `.anchor`, `.intra`) — the one
  path every outbound/internal link record is classified and wrapped through, so the same
  four partitions apply across HTML, PDF and the office formats without re-derivation.
- `runtime-limits`: `boundOf` and `statement` (its R29-R31), for every ceiling this module keeps (R12, R35, R44), with no numeric literal for one (K4835 (1)).
- `test-support`: `docgen`, `sheetgen`, `zipChunks64` and their truth (its R19, R21-R24), for the tests at the platform's shape.
- `ooxml`: `decodeText` (its R36) and `streamMember` for R41 and R43, and the container primitives — `hasZipMagic`, `readContainer`, `readPart`,
  `normalizePartName`, `discriminate` (the full magic + parts + declared-content-type
  discrimination), `walkRels`/`parseRels`/`relsPartFor`, `sizeGuard` and
  `declaredTextBytes` with the measured bound `MEASURED_OOXML_TEXT_BOUND_BYTES`,
  `CORE_PROPERTIES_PART`/`readCoreProperties`, `withContainerImages`, and (T35-9)
  `readVbaProject` with `VBA_AUTORUN_NAMES`/`VBA_SUSPICIOUS_KEYWORDS` and the limits
  `MEMBER_MAX`/`ARCHIVE_TOTAL_MAX` (its R30–R33).
- `csv-reader`: `sheetCellRef`, `usedSheetRange` (its R10, R11), re-exported by `formats-xlsx.mjs`, and `columnLetters`, `sheetRangeRef` (implementation; `docx.mjs` and `odf.mjs` import them through `formats-xlsx.mjs`); `csv.mjs` re-exports its `csvEntry`.
- `setup-words`: `word`, `localize` (the words rule: a sentence people read is read by key; K3930, K3943, K3949).

### Invariants

- **R20** Pure: no store, no network, no clock in any output. The same input bytes always
  give the same answer (a sha256 over embedded/table bytes is a deterministic function of
  those bytes, not an external fact).
- **R21** Never throws (stated above under Errors); every failure this module can name is a
  returned `{ok:false, ...}` or a carried `undetermined` entry.
- **R22** Never invents structure. A reference, a link target, a slide number or a table's
  extent this module cannot establish is a STATED `undetermined` naming the part and why —
  never silently dropped and never guessed. An unreadable `.rels` part states that links MAY
  be missing; it is never read as zero links.
- **R23** Nothing this module marks `hidden` — a PPTX slide, an XLSX sheet, row or column —
  is ever omitted from `text()`'s output for being hidden. Hiding is a fact about the file
  (DEC-5), surfaced as a flag, never a reason to drop content.
- **R24** This module asserts nothing about MEANING (that judgment belongs to `content`/
  `entities`, through I2) and writes nothing to the record.
- **R25** No place is named in this module; it holds no jurisdiction-specific behaviour to
  take from a profile (confirmed by reading all three files: the one match for "Oakland" is
  a corpus filename cited as measurement evidence in a design comment, not a fact the code
  branches on).

### Satisfies

- `BIO_Content_Framework_v0_10.md`, Part I §4 (the FORMAT axis) and the I7 registry entry
  shape and IC-1 element-reference union built from it.
- `docs/development/OFFICE-FORMATS.md`, the ruled sections: "What each part-map offers",
  "What these formats carry" (the DEC-5 evidentiary extras), "The architectural answer"
  (the I7 entry shape), "Bounds and the size guard".
- `docs/development/CONTENT-EXTENT-DESIGN-SPACE.md` §6, the extent grammar this module's
  reference builders instantiate for the `doc-para`, `doc-table`, `sheet-cell`,
  `sheet-range` and `slide-shape` kinds.
- K4831 (7) and K4834 (fix round 9): every part of a document read and searchable, each result marked with its kind; Excel date cells typed as dates with the original number kept beside (reverses R30's T33 rule); K4837: the retained-objects and decoded-characters bounds stated by name before the walk (R38, R42, R44).
- Bob's rulings: DEC-5 (2026-08-01 — surface tracked changes, comments, speaker notes,
  hidden state and document metadata as evidence; never redact); K1888
  (2026-10-06, the virus package: the readers' structure check, `build/plan/study-virus-scanning.md`
  §3 A), R32; K1881 with F18 of `build/plan/draft-T35-security-review.md` (a cap and a
  total on every part read), R12.

### Suggestions

- `docx.mjs`/`pptx.mjs`'s graceful degradation on an unreadable main part (R4) versus
  `formats-xlsx.mjs`'s hard failure on an unreadable workbook part (R5) is a difference a
  caller need not branch on specially: both surface through `parts().ok` and
  `parts().undetermined`, and `structure()`/`text()` read either outcome honestly.
  Whether to make xlsx degrade the same way as docx/pptx (skip the sheet roster, not the
  whole read) is open; nothing today asks for it.
- The evidentiary envelope's items (tracked changes, comments, formulas, speaker notes,
  hidden state, core properties) are extracted but not yet indexed as searchable content —
  a NINTH extent kind, `envelope`, is DESIGNED but NOT BUILT (`OFFICE-FORMATS.md`, D-124's
  2026-07-31 row). That is `content`'s work, through an interface change, not this
  module's: this module's evidentiary envelope is already the shape that kind would read
  from.
- `columnLetters`, `sheetRangeRef`, `walkDocumentBody`, `walkDocumentTables`,
  `parseComments`, `walkSlide`,
  and the `*_CONTENT_TYPE` constants
  are exported and used only within this module's own three files and their own tests
  today — no other module imports them (checked by grep across `bio-plane/src`,
  `docprofile`, `pdf-worker`, `ocr-worker`). They are implementation, not Provides; a job
  promotes one to Provides only once another module actually imports it.
- D-415's target behaviour (R9: defined names and table parts each emitting their own
  `sheet-range` unit, a multi-area name skipped with a stated reason) is written above as
  the ruled requirement. The job that meets it should reuse `usedSheetRange`'s shape for
  the emitted unit rather than hand-building a `sheet-range` object a second way.
- DIST-14's bound question (R11; csv's is csv-reader R6) is not this module's to resolve: the deciding
  measurement needs a deployed plane, which is DIST's act. Until it lands, the bound stays
  `MEASURED_OOXML_TEXT_BOUND_BYTES` reused, and a job on this module should not change the
  figure without a new measurement recorded under `measurements/`.
- R32's `active` is the office half of the per-capture "active content" list (the PDF half is
  `pdf-reader`'s R36); the threat grade, the members' warning and the assistant's rule
  read it downstream (K1888), so its item shape should stay plain data. The VBA parsing is
  `ooxml`'s (P6: this module is about 3,300 lines (csv moved out, T51); the job reports if it would pass about
  4,000). A test fixture with a VBA project can be any small `.docm` whose olevba report is
  recorded beside it.
