# workbooks — requirements

**Status** · In force: a new product module, reviewed (K1505; T33-42, entered on GO with conditions, K1506), the workbook path in its own module (K1504). Last changed T35 (R8 quotes DEC-149's wording, K1966); every requirement met (WORKBOOKS #2, K1969). Fix round 9 (T51; K4831 (10), K4835 (1)): R20, R21 new, a workbook held whole up to 250,000 cells and an add that counts what it drops (G137e); R1, R2 amended, their bounds quoted from `READ_BOUNDS`; marked not yet met (T51).

**Size (P6).** About 1,500–2,200 lines with tests.

## Public

### Purpose

The second engine of the calculation: a member's own spreadsheet analysis held in the record. A member uploads an analysis workbook and binds its input cells, cell for cell, to captured sources. The instance recomputes the formulas with its own pinned engine and compares the results with the file's cached values: agreement between two engines, not accuracy. The workbook is linted for the usual spreadsheet defects and carries a method note and, optionally, a second member's check. A recipe calculation can also be exported to XLSX. A workbook the engine cannot recompute is recorded and disclosed as "not recomputed here". Nothing here is a gate.

### Provides

Terms. A **workbook** is a held capture of an `.xlsx` file, added to a project, keyed by its capture sha and project. An **input cell** is a cell holding a constant that a formula reads. A **binding** ties a rectangle of input cells to a source: a range of a declared table (`calculations`) or a cited figure (a content extent). The **viewer** and `by` are the control plane's stamps; a missing viewer fails closed. Every refusal is `{ok: false, reason, detail}`. `workbooksOf(ctx)` takes `ctx.recompute(captureSha)`, the plane's call to `sheet-worker`.

**addWorkbook({captureSha, question, period, project, by}), readWorkbook({captureSha, project, viewer})**
- **R1** `addWorkbook` refuses, in order: `NO_SHA`; `CAPTURE_NOT_HELD` (no such capture, or one the actor may not see, answered alike); `NOT_A_WORKBOOK` (`office-readers` gives no `cells` for it, with its reason, over the size guard included); `NO_QUESTION`; `NO_PERIOD`; `NO_PROJECT`. Otherwise the workbook is held with its question, period, project, the capture's origin as provenance states it, and its author. A repeat answers `already: true`. (Amended, fix round 6, G44; K4680.) refuses, in order, `NO_SHA`; `CAPTURE_NOT_HELD` (by the evidence store's head); `NO_QUESTION`; `NO_PERIOD`; `NO_PROJECT`; a repeat answers `already: true`; then `WORKBOOK_FILE_TOO_LARGE` {size, bound} (a capture stored above the file bound, checked before its bytes load, a capture held in parts by its total; or a file whose text the reader will not hold), `NOT_A_WORKBOOK`, `WORKBOOK_TOO_LARGE` {cells, bound_cells} (more cells than the cells bound, or cells whose JSON is longer than the JSON bound); each bound is a `READ_BOUNDS` row read through `boundOf` (R20), never a literal here, each refusal states its figures through `statement` and the condition, writes nothing.
- **R2** `readWorkbook` answers the workbook with its bindings (R3, R4), its inputs (R5), its latest recompute (R6–R8), its lint (R9), its method notes (R10), its checks (R11), its grade facts (R12) and the disclosure (R8). It never recomputes. (Amended, fix round 6, G44; K4680.) New: R2 and every read or act that loads a workbook's cells (`readWorkbook`, `inputsOf`, `lint`, `explainLint`, `recompute`) counts the stored cells first and, above the cells bound (R20), answers `WORKBOOK_TOO_LARGE`; the bound is set by measure so the largest workbook the add holds survives all of them. R19 unchanged. Rows owed to UX-DESIGN: `refusal.WORKBOOK_TOO_LARGE` ({cells}, {bound_cells}), `refusal.WORKBOOK_FILE_TOO_LARGE` ({size}, {bound} in MB); their `en` is in `index.mjs`.

**bind({captureSha, project, range, input, by}), unbind({bindingId, reason, by}), inputsOf({captureSha, project, viewer})**
- **R3** `bind` refuses: `NO_SUCH_WORKBOOK`; `BAD_RANGE` (not one rectangle on one sheet of the workbook); `RANGE_HOLDS_FORMULAS` (an input is a constant, never a formula cell); `NO_SUCH_INPUT` (a table sha `calculations` does not hold, a range outside it, or an extent not held); `SHAPE_MISMATCH` (the range and the input differ in rows or columns). Otherwise it holds the binding with who and when. `unbind` refuses `NO_REASON`; an unbound binding stays, shown with who, when and why.
- **R4** Each bound cell is compared with its source cell for cell: numbers by exact decimal value (`calc-grammar`), text and booleans exactly. The binding answers `{agrees, compared, differing: [{cell, workbook_value, source_value}]}`. A differing binding is held and shown as differing, never corrected and never refused.
- **R5** `inputsOf` answers every input cell, each bound (naming its binding) or unbound. An unbound input is testimony, graded D (K1447 (ii)).

**recompute({captureSha, project, by})**
- **R6** It asks `ctx.recompute` for the workbook and pairs each recomputed formula cell with the cached value `office-readers` reads for it (its R30 `cached`): numbers agree within a relative 1e-9, text and booleans exactly. It records `{status, engine, engine_version, at, counts: {compared, agreed, differed, not_recomputed, volatile, cache_stale}, differing, not_recomputed}`, `status` one of `agrees`, `differs`, `partial` or `not recomputed here`.
- **R7** A cell the engine gives an error value is listed in `not_recomputed` with its `cause`, never counted as a disagreement. A volatile cell is listed and never compared. A cell whose cached value is an error while the engine gives a value is counted `cache_stale`, never a disagreement. A whole-workbook refusal (not enabled, engine absent, over a bound, external links, time limit, no binding to the engine, or no answer) records `status: "not recomputed here"` with the reason as given.
- **R8** Every answer that states a recompute calls it agreement between the file's engine and the engine your group's Civicsmith runs, never accuracy, and carries the disclosure "recomputed by the engine your group's Civicsmith runs (<engine> <version>); open it in any spreadsheet program" (DEC-149's wording, K1965), with the engine's measured agreement on the corpus (cells and workbooks whole, as `sheet-worker`'s job records it). Results are recomputed only by this act, never on a read.

**lint({captureSha, project, viewer}), explainLint({captureSha, project, finding, note, by})**
- **R9** `lint` answers each finding `{kind, cell, detail}`, `kind` one of: `short_range` (an aggregate's range stops short of, or starts after, the contiguous run of numbers in its column or row); `constant_in_formula` (a number written inside a formula); `hidden_input` (an input cell in a hidden row, column or sheet); `number_as_text` (an input whose stored type is text but whose text is a figure); `error_value` (a cached error value); `cross_foot` (a block whose row totals and column totals do not sum to the same grand total). Lint changes nothing and blocks nothing. `explainLint` holds a member's note against a finding (`NO_NOTE` when blank), kept and never erased.

**recordMethodNote({captureSha, project, purpose, sources, steps, limitations, by})**
- **R10** Each field is required (`NO_PURPOSE`, `NO_SOURCES`, `NO_STEPS`, `NO_LIMITATIONS`), the documentation an audit's data-reliability test asks for. A new note supersedes the last, and every note is kept with who and when.

**recordCheck({captureSha, project, outcome, note, by})**
- **R11** A second member's check: refused `SELF_CHECK` when `by` is the workbook's author, and `UNKNOWN_OUTCOME` outside `agrees`, `disagrees`, `could_not_check`. It is disclosed on every read with who and when. Nothing refuses, waits or warns for want of one (K1448).

**Grade facts and sight**
- **R12** `readWorkbook` answers grade facts on the terms of K1447 (ii): each bound input's capture grade, capped by its derivation; each unbound input D; each formula result carrying the derivation step "third-party engine" at `undetermined`, whatever the recompute found; the method disclosed, not graded. `strength` reads them.
- **R13** A workbook whose capture, or any bound source, the viewer may not see is withheld whole: every read answers it exactly as an absent one (DEC-36, DEC-85).

**exportRecipe({calcId, viewer}) → XLSX bytes**
- **R14** For a calculation the viewer may see (else `found: false`), it answers a workbook that opens in any spreadsheet program: one sheet per input table (its canonical values as typed cells); a results sheet; a method sheet naming the question, period, recipe, method version, result key and each input's sha256. Each result of a `count`, `sum`, `difference`, `ratio` or `share` step is written as a formula over the input sheets whose cached value is the stored result; any other step's result is written as a value labelled "computed by bio-calc/1". Recomputing the exported file gives the stored results.

**The ops map**
- **R15** The module publishes `workbooksOps(workbooks, url, body)`, one route arm per act and read above; one append site, stamped by the control plane.

## Private

### Uses

- `calculations`: `readTable` (R3, R4, R14, R23; its `rows: "all"`, calculations R48), `read` (R14), the grade facts of a table's source (R12).
- (fix round 9; K4835 (1)) `runtime-limits`: `READ_BOUNDS`, `boundOf` and `statement` (`runtime-limits` R29-R31) for the add's file, cells and JSON bounds (R1, R2, R20), a new `modules.json` edge; the service named, no figure typed here.
- `calc-grammar`: `parseFigure` and exact decimal comparison (R4), `resultKey` (R14).
- `office-readers`: typed cells with formula and cached value (R30), hidden rows, columns and sheets and external references (R9, R10), `sheet-cell` references (R17).
- `record-core`: `transact`, `declareTable`. `membership`: `viewerPredicate`. `provenance`, `content`: whether a capture is held, its origin, its bytes' reading, and an extent's visibility (R1, R3, R13). *(edges beyond the plan's list; see the report)*

### Invariants

- **R16** Not a gate: no act of any module is refused, delayed or warned because a workbook was not recomputed, differed, has lint findings or lacks a second check. The publication rule that refuses only an undisclosed differing or unbound load-bearing calculation (K1448; DEC-76.4) is `case-authoring`'s pre-flight (T33-69, C:A-15), reading R2 (wording, K1632).
- **R17** No macro is run, no external link is followed and no formula is evaluated in this module; the only computation is `sheet-worker`'s and `calc-grammar`'s. No number is stored but the file's cells, the engine's results and the sources' values.
- **R18** No place is named in behaviour, defaults or outward text. Tables (workbooks, bindings, recomputes, lint notes, method notes, checks) are declared through `record-core.declareTable`, export `yes`, keyed to their project for purge.

### Satisfies

- `docs/architecture/BIO_Capability_Ladders_v0_1.md` §8.2 D2, C4, E1; §8.3 L3; §8.4 L3 (the workbook path: bind cell for cell; recompute as agreement between two engines, D110; volatile functions flagged, macros never run, external links refused; the lint list; a method note against the GAGAS test; a second member's check, disclosed, never a gate; export from recipe to XLSX; "not recomputed here"); §2 ANALYSIS.
- Plan T33, "Measured GO (K1506)" and entry T33-42; rulings K1447 (ii), K1448, K1506; DEC-36, DEC-85, DEC-112.

### Suggestions

- **Identity.** A workbook is keyed by its capture sha and project, as `calculations` keys a table by its sha; there is no new id prefix. Whether a workbook should also be a `CALC-` (one construct, two engines) needs `calculations` to accept a second engine, which its draft rules out. BOB's.
- **R12 and the engine's measure.** K1447 (ii) keeps a third-party engine's value `undetermined` "until measured". The corpus measure reads 98.9% of cells and 71% of workbooks whole. Whether that counts as measured, and so lifts R12's `undetermined`, is BOB's.
- **The engine call.** The plane wires `ctx.recompute` to the `SHEET_WORKER` binding, as it does for `ocr-worker`. With no binding, R7 records "not recomputed here: no engine bound".
- **Export.** Writing XLSX needs a small writer. `ooxml` reads containers only, so the writer is this module's own, or a later `ooxml` service (BOB's). R14's test can recompute the export through `sheet-worker`'s test build.
- Tests: a binding that differs by one cent (R4); an unbound input graded D (R5, R12); each R7 case from the corpus fixtures; each lint kind with a negative control; a self-check refused (R11); a hidden bound source (R13); an act elsewhere passing with no check and a differing recompute (R16).

- **R19** *(not yet met: T51)* (T51; K4168; the T51 declaration pass; op-declarations R80, R81; op-grades R49, R50; test-support R15) **The module declares the ops it serves that the screens send.** `DECLARED_OPS` is exported beside the ops map: a frozen object keyed by the op's door name, each row `{classes, machineClasses?, mutating, weight, description, fields: {accepts, requires}}`, its class, weight and description copied from the op's existing rows and its fields read from the arm whole (the stamps and the shell's `reason` are not accepts unless the arm reads a `reason` of its own): `addworkbook`, `bind`, `recordcheck`. Test: `declaredOpHolds` for each, with only its requires, without each, and with a field outside its accepts (`declared-ops.test.mjs`).

- **R20** (fix round 9, G137e; K4831 (10), K4835 (1); amends R1, R2) **An analysis workbook is held whole, up to 250,000 cells.** The add's bounds, the capture's bytes, the cells and the cells' JSON, are `READ_BOUNDS` rows read through `boundOf` (`runtime-limits` R29-R31); the cells row is 250,000, the figure `sheet-worker` R14 holds as `MAX_CELLS`, so a workbook the add holds is never refused by the engine for its cells, and R1's and R2's refusals state the size and the bound through `statement`. A workbook of up to that many cells is held whole; only the cells a binding, a citation, a lint finding or a recompute touches are interpreted (typed, compared, graded), the others are held as the file states them. The bound is set by measure, as R2 states, so the largest workbook the add holds survives the add, the read, the lint, the inputs and the recompute. Test: SHEET X20, workbooks of 50,000, 130,000, 250,000 and 250,001 cells through add, bind and recompute: the first three accepted, the fourth refused `WORKBOOK_TOO_LARGE` with its count and the bound, nothing written. Control: the largest accepted workbook survives every act of R2; no literal for a bound is found in the module.
- **R21** (fix round 9, G137e; SHEET B-4, E-22, S-26, S-32; amends R1) **`addWorkbook` counts what it drops and never throws on a cell with no reference.** A `<c>` element with no `r` is not thrown on: it is dropped with the cells whose reference is unreadable or repeats another's, and the answer states how many cells it dropped and why (no reference, unreadable, repeated), never `ok: true` with nothing said. Test: SHEET X12, rows whose cells carry no `r`: the add is accepted, nothing is thrown, the count of dropped cells is stated; a workbook with a repeated reference states one dropped repeat. Control: a workbook whose cells all carry their references drops none and states none. **Amended (fix round 9, G186; K5025; follows office-readers R48):** a row or cell with no `r` is placed by its position in the file (each row the one after the last, each cell the column after the last), as office-readers R48 reads it, and is held, never dropped; only a cell whose reference is unreadable or repeats another's is dropped and counted. Test: SHEET X12's cells with no `r` are held at their positions and read as a referenced copy reads; a repeated reference is still one counted drop. *(not yet met: T51)*
- **R22** (fix round 9, G182; K5017; S-31; moved from calculations R50) **`exportRecipe` is bounded.** It refuses, with its size and bound, a recipe past the workbook bound (`READ_BOUNDS`), never writes past column XFD, and builds the file without a whole-file base64 copy in memory. Test: one past the bound refused with size and bound; one at XFD accepted.
- **R23** (fix round 9, G182; K5017; follows calculations R48) **A bound table is read whole by asking for it.** Where the module binds or exports a whole table (`addWorkbook`'s bind, `exportRecipe`), it calls `calculations.readTable` with `rows: "all"`, never relying on a page answer being the whole table. Test: a bind and an export of a table of more rows than one page carry every row.
