# membership — requirements

**Status** · In force: approved by Bob 2026-09-26 (a product module, P17), with his rulings as R62 and R63; later folds reviewed, DEC-132 to DEC-136 Bob's. Split for size (K617, K636, K637, K653): sessions, passwords, signer keys and AI credentials moved to `credentials`, their ids retired here with pointers. Last changed T50 (T50-2: R146 new, `MODULE_ORDER` assembled from `build/modules.json` (amends R83, R140, R145, R79's order), N1115, N1171, K657, K3268; R147 new, `memberList` answers the founder's row, N1119, K3369; R148 new, `lookedAt`, N1092, DEC-238; R149 and R150 new, a viewer that carries a project and the reach beyond the project's own records, N1186, K3557; R151 new, words by key, N1116, DEC-257, DEC-258); those marked not yet met (T50). Before that T48 (T48-9: R83 re-pinned to `build/modules.json` after T48's opening, `ai-accounts`, `signin-door` and `journey-check` gained and `setup-page` dropped, N1014, N1055, K657, K3100, K3196; R44 amended, the sight levels spelled as `sight` answers them, N1019, K3112; R143 new, the mark of when a member last looked at Home, N1036, K3146, K3189); those marked not yet met (T48). Before that T47 (T47-7: R83 re-pinned to the six modules T47's opening adds, and its T46 tolerance to none of T46's six, K657, N991; R132 new, REC-41's pre-auth `bootstrap` rule stated, widened by name to `test_instance` and three flat `part_*` keys, N989, K3027); those marked not yet met (T47). Before that T46 (T46-4: R124 retired by refusal, R129 new (`op=handlechange` refuses every change `HANDLE_FIXED`), R16, R17, R125, R126 amended; DEC-197, DEC-196, N934, K2903; R83 re-pinned to the six new layer-11 modules, K657, K2914; R128's `PROJECT_GUARD_UNCHECKED` kept until its word conforms to R112, K2917; R130 new, the doors' settings and history, N654); those marked not yet met (T46). Before that T41 (T41-3: the Terms' sight, R18, R43, R44, R60, R77, R88, R120 amended for administrators' sight of hidden projects, N822, D54, K2408, K2409; R83 re-pinned, K657; R123, R124, R126 read the handle refusals by key, DEC-188 (7)); those marked not yet met (T41). Before that T40 (T40-M: R16, R17, R55, R57, R83 amended; R122–R126 new; N797, N799, N812; DEC-184, DEC-186; K2373, K2376); those marked not yet met (T40). Before that T38 (N783; K617, K624, K2270): split for size again, by C1′: the roster's reads, ownership, the visibility history and directory, and requests to join moved to `project-roster` (R37, R39–R42, R46, R48–R53, R63 retired here with pointers); R59, R82 and R96 retired and split (R113–R115 here); R116–R120 added as `project-roster`'s seams; R33 and R45 re-pointed to the new slots and R11, R36, R60, R75, R84, R111 to the new ids, meaning unchanged; R83 re-pinned. Before that T37 (T37-44: R83 re-pinned, no text change, now naming `image-cover`; K1185, K2171), before that T36 (T36-6: R83 re-pinned, no text change, its rule naming every module `build/modules.json` names, now `file-scanner`, `file-safety`, `law-relations`, `op-grades`, `answer-envelope`, `store-door` with them; K1961, K2008), cross-references re-pointed T35 (K2035); every requirement met (MEMBERSHIP #27, K2090) but those marked (T38).

## Public

### Purpose

Owns who the members are and what each may do: the founder, administrators, invitations and enrolment, capabilities, declared expertise; and projects as working groups at their setup: inviting, joining, leaving and removing participants, the visibility setting, the participation record, what a caller may see of a project, and the fence that says who may act in one. The roster's reads, ownership votes and rescue, the directory and requests to join are `project-roster`'s. It holds no integrity of the record (Membership v2 §2), and no credential: sessions and passwords, signer keys and AI credentials are `credentials`'.

### Provides

Terms. *Administrators* are the founder (the root of trust's session, id `admin`, exported as `Membership.ROOT_ADMIN` for a caller that must name her (N1067), once the instance is claimed) and every member with role `admin` and status `active`. An act's `by` is the actor the control plane stamps, never the caller's claim. *Sight* of a project is `FULL`, `EXISTENCE` or `NONE` (R44). `EXISTENCE` has two forms: a member outside a discoverable project sees its id and name; an administrator (the founder included) neither invited nor joined to a hidden project sees its id, name and owners' handles (D54; K2408, K2409). Every service that names a project answers a caller at `EXISTENCE` with `PROJECT_SEEN_NOT_A_PARTICIPANT` (R44) and a caller at `NONE` exactly as an id that names nothing, before any other check, except the administrator's acts R60 keeps reachable at `EXISTENCE`; a `viewer` never sent (an internal caller) is not asked. Every refusal names its reason; no service throws.

  `words` is the key and its English as `words.json` holds them, read by key (`handle.free`, `handle.taken`, `handle.characters`), placeholders left for the screen. The answer never says who holds a handle, whether that member is active, or whether the handle is someone's earlier one: `taken` is one answer. Each call counts against a two-bucket window (`credentials` R38's form; `doorbell` R2's) of 60 checks in any 10 minutes per invitation, or per member when asked by `viewer`; at 60 it answers `HANDLE_CHECK_PAUSED` with `stated` and `retryAfter`, before the handle is read, its member-facing sentence `words.json`'s `handle.refused.paused`, read by key, `{minutes}` the whole minutes until `retryAfter`, rounded up (DEC-188 (7)). It writes only its count, and never throws. (The per-source window over every public op is `admission` R21's.) `handle.changeable` and `handle.formerly` are the screens' words (they carry no refusal), read by the screens from `words.json`; nothing here answers them.
- **R124** *(retired (T46; DEC-197, Bob: a member's handle is chosen at joining and never changed, "for the time being"; K2903): no handle is changed; `op=handlechange` is R129's refusal; its earlier-handles clause is R16's, its handle history R57's and R115's)*
- **R129** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R53, T51, K624, K3946)*
- **R125** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R51, T51, K624, K3946)*

- **R100** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R36, T51, K624, K3946)*

**Declared and confirmed expertise**

- **R24** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R20, T51, K624, K3946)*
- **R106** (DEC-135 (2), (5)) `checkAddressees({target, label})` answers who a check request about `target` (a bundle id) reaches: every `active` member whose current state for `label` (normalised as R21) is declared or confirmed and whom R80 admits to `target` (`inSight(target, "member:<id>")`), each `{memberId, handle, state}`, `state` `declared` or `confirmed`, in member-id order. `EXPERTISE_NO_LABEL` for an empty label; `[]` for a target not held or seen by no one. It addresses only: it writes nothing, grants no sight or act (R24), and never throws. (The request and the check record are `tasks`'.)

**The group's own settings** (homes named by BOB at T34's opening)
- **R107** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R42, T51, K624, K3946)*

- **R110** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R45, T51, K624, K3946)*

**Signing keys** (moved to `credentials`, K637)
- **R25** *(retired: moved to `credentials` R6, K617, K637)*
- **R26** *(retired: moved to `credentials` R7, K617, K637)*
- **R27** *(retired: moved to `credentials` R8, K617, K637)*

- **R90** *(retired: moved to `credentials` R10, K617, K637)*

**AI credentials** (moved to `credentials`, K637)
- **R28** *(retired: moved to `credentials` R12, K617, K637)*
- **R62** *(retired: moved to `credentials` R13, K617, K637)*

- **R30** *(retired: moved to `credentials` R15; its named copy `aiCredentialLook` was removed once its callers re-pointed (K636 BOB-1; T21 N453))*

**Project participation**
- **R31** `projectClaimOwner({projectId, memberId})` makes the member the project's sole initial owner, joined: `NO_SUCH_PROJECT`, `NOT_A_PROJECT`, `OWNED` when an owner exists.
- **R32** `projectInvite({projectId, handle, by, viewer})`: `NOT_THE_OWNER`; `NO_SUCH_HANDLE`; `NOT_ACTIVE`; `ALREADY_A_PARTICIPANT`. Records the member `invited` with `invited_by` = `by`.
- **R33** In the same act, R32 tells R116's listener, by which `project-roster` (its R15) closes an open request to join from that member (its R10) `granted`, by `by`.
- **R34** `projectJoin({projectId, by, viewer})`: `NOT_INVITED` for a non-participant; otherwise the participant is `joined` (idempotent; it withdraws a request to leave).
- **R35** `projectLeave({projectId, by, comment, viewer})`: `NOT_A_PARTICIPANT` (R87); `NOT_JOINED`; records `leaving` with the comment (at most 280 characters) and removes nobody. An owner is refused `LAST_COMMITTED_OWNER` when no other owner is committed (an owner not `leaving`).
- **R36** `projectRemove({projectId, handle, by, comment, viewer})`: `NOT_THE_OWNER` (administrators included); `NO_SUCH_HANDLE`; `TARGET_NOT_A_PARTICIPANT` (C-56.4); `OWNER` for an owner (`project-roster` R4 first). Removes the participant whether or not they asked to leave.
- **R63** *(retired: moved to `project-roster` R2, T38, N783)*
- **R37** *(retired: moved to `project-roster` R1, T38, N783)*

**Project ownership**
- **R38** `ownerMath(n)`: n ≤ 1 impossible (the floor is one owner); n = 2 needs both, the target voting (`targetMayVote: true`); n ≥ 3 is `adminMath`'s majority with the target counted and not voting. `projectOwnerArithmetic({projectId, viewer})` gives the table for 1..9 and the live row, which reads as `ownerMath(0)` for a project the viewer cannot see.
- **R39** *(retired: moved to `project-roster` R3, T38, N783)*
- **R40** *(retired: moved to `project-roster` R4, T38, N783)*
- **R41** *(retired: moved to `project-roster` R5, T38, N783)*
- **R42** *(retired: moved to `project-roster` R6, T38, N783)*

**Sight and visibility**
- **R43** `viewerPredicate(viewer)` is the one rule of what a viewer may see: a machine credential sees every bundle; the founder's viewer sees every bundle except a hidden project (R85) in which the founder (member `admin`) is neither invited nor joined, and every bundle that belongs to such a project (D54); a `member:<id>` viewer sees every bundle that is neither a project nor belongs to one, a project only as a participant (any state) or as an active administrator, save that an active administrator sees a hidden project only as a participant (D54; a discoverable project stays seen whole by administrators, K2409), and a bundle that belongs to a project (`record-core` R34's `project`, which `promotion` writes from the document, its R53; N426) exactly when it would see that project; any other viewer sees nothing. It also returns the viewer's member id (null for a machine). The founder's viewer is spelled bare `admin` or `member:admin`; both see what the founder's arm admits, and the member id the rule returns is `admin` for the second and null for the first.
- **R44** `sight(projectId, viewer)` is `FULL` when R43 admits the viewer; else `EXISTENCE` for a project set discoverable, asked by a viewer naming a member, and for a hidden project asked by the founder's viewer or an active administrator's that R43 does not admit (neither invited nor joined; D54); else `NONE`. At `EXISTENCE` an act, and a read naming the project's own id, is refused `PROJECT_SEEN_NOT_A_PARTICIPANT` carrying only the id and name, and, for an administrator at a hidden project's `EXISTENCE`, its owners' handles (R77), and nothing else; the acts R60 names stay reachable there. A read of anything inside the project, and every search, list and reverse edge, is never widened by `EXISTENCE`. (T48; N1019, K3112) `sight` answers the three levels as the strings `"full"`, `"existence"` and `"none"`, exported as `Membership.SIGHT_FULL`, `SIGHT_EXISTENCE` and `SIGHT_NONE`; `FULL`, `EXISTENCE` and `NONE` in this file name those values.
- **R45** `projectVisibilitySet({projectId, setting, reason, by, viewer})`: `NOT_A_PROJECT`; `PROJECT_VISIBILITY_NOT_THE_OWNER` (administrators and the founder included); `PROJECT_VISIBILITY_UNKNOWN_SETTING` unless `discoverable` or `hidden`. Appends a record with `by`, date and reason; the latest record is the setting; a project with none is `hidden`. Setting `hidden` tells R117's listener, by which `project-roster` (its R16) lapses every open request to join it, recorded with `by`.
- **R46** *(retired: moved to `project-roster` R8, T38, N783)*
- **R47** `visibilitySettingRefusal(value)` answers `PROJECT_VISIBILITY_UNKNOWN_SETTING` for anything but the two settings, so a creation and R45 cannot disagree.
- **R85** (N332, K412) `visibilityOf(projectId)` answers the id's current visibility setting, `discoverable` or `hidden`, and `hidden` when none is recorded (R45's latest record). It is one indexed read, asks no viewer (it states only the setting, which R44 already uses to answer `EXISTENCE`; its callers gate what they show by R44), writes nothing, and never refuses or throws. `store-door` R2's existence read calls it.
- **R86** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R29, T51, K624, K3946)*

**notAParticipant(projectId, by, extra?) → refusal** (N335, K275; a module-level function)
- **R87** The one answer to one condition: the caller `by` holds no participation in the project (Membership v2 §7.12). It answers `{ok: false, reason: "NOT_A_PARTICIPANT", code, check, translation, project, detail}`, `detail` one fixed sentence; `extra` adds a caller's own fields and never replaces these. R35 here and `promotion` R43 answer through it. Its row is this module's C-56.3. It writes nothing and never throws.
- **R88** (N352, K477) `hiddenBundles(viewer)` is the one spelling of the complement of R43's rule: `null` when R43 lets the viewer see every bundle (its machine arm; no longer the founder's viewer, D54), otherwise `{sql, args}`, a subquery over record-core's `bundles` naming every bundle R43 does not pass for that viewer (every bundle, for a viewer R43 refuses; for the founder's viewer and an active administrator's, the hidden projects R43 withholds from them and the bundles belonging to them). Every module that subtracts the bundles a viewer may not see reads it (`record-core`'s figure sources under its R63, `queue`, `retrieval`; the legacy store's count subtraction was the first, now gone); what an absent viewer means stays the caller's (the store's internal call reads whole and does not ask). It writes nothing and never throws.

- **R48** *(retired: moved to `project-roster` R9, T38, N783)*

**Requests to join** (moved to `project-roster`, N783)
- **R49** *(retired: moved to `project-roster` R10, T38, N783)*
- **R50** *(retired: moved to `project-roster` R11, T38, N783)*
- **R51** *(retired: moved to `project-roster` R12, T38, N783)*
- **R52** *(retired: moved to `project-roster` R13, T38, N783)*
- **R53** *(retired: moved to `project-roster` R14, T38, N783)*

**The fence: who may act in a project**
- **R54** `isProjectOwner(projectId, memberId)` is true exactly for a participant with the owner flag; `isJoinedParticipant` for a participant `joined` or `leaving`.
- **R55** `projectAuthority(projectId, identity, need, act)` returns null or a refusal: `need: "owner"` refuses `PROJECT_ACT_NOT_THE_OWNER` to anyone but an owner, answered through `notTheOwner` (R122) (T40; K2394 Z8); `need: "joined"` refuses `PROJECT_ACT_NOT_A_PARTICIPANT` to anyone not joined or leaving. Sight, administrator status and the founder's session confer neither. An identity naming no member (absent, or a machine credential) is not asked.
- **R56** `caseAuthority({project, deliveredBy, signer, act, subject})`: unless `deliveredBy` is the founder, delivery needs `projectAuthority(project, deliveredBy, "joined")`; then the signer must be an owner of the project, else `CASE_SIGNER_NOT_AN_OWNER`, which is also the answer for a production naming no project.

**Facts later modules read (K57)**
- **R64** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R23, T51, K624, K3946)*
- **R65** `projectOwners(projectId)` lists the owners' member ids in the order they became owners; `[]` for no owner or no such project.
- **R66** `isProjectEditor(projectId, memberId)` is true exactly for an owner or a `joined` participant (never one `leaving`; R54's joined-or-leaving is a different set).
- **R67** `ownsAnyProject(memberId)` is true exactly when the member owns at least one project.
- **R68** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R24, T51, K624, K3946)*
- **R69** `activeParticipants(projectId)` lists the member ids of participants `joined` (not `leaving`, not invited) whose member is `active`.
- **R127** (K2404; for `credentials` R54, R59) `joinedParticipants(projectId)` answers `[{member, owner, since}]`, one per participant `joined` or `leaving` (R54's `isJoinedParticipant` set), whatever the member's status: `owner` the owner flag, `since` the instant the participant's row last became `joined` (a project's creation for its founding owner), recorded from T40 by the act that joins; `null` for a row joined before it was recorded. An unknown project answers `[]`. Never throws, writes nothing.
- **R128** (T45; Actions D4; v0.2 rule 15; R125's form) `registerProjectActGuard(module, fn)`: one later module (`project-roster`, its R22) registers once at start; a malformed registration is refused `LISTENER_MALFORMED` and a second, whoever makes it, `LISTENER_DECLARED` naming the holder, both through R81. R32 and R45 call `fn({act, projectId, by, setting?})` (`act` `invite` or `visibility`) synchronously inside their act, after their own refusals and before any write; a refusal it answers is answered unchanged and nothing is written; null lets the act proceed; a guard that throws or answers anything else refuses `PROJECT_GUARD_UNCHECKED` (fail closed, as R124). With none registered the acts proceed as today. This module never reads another module's tables to decide it. (T46; DEC-194; N913) `PROJECT_GUARD_UNCHECKED`'s row (C-56.6) keeps its present translation in T46: `words.json`'s `refusal.PROJECT_GUARD_UNCHECKED` names "Civicsmith" bare, against R112's "your group's Civicsmith", and is returned to the design stream (K2917); the row is read by key once that word conforms.
- **R70** *(retired: moved to `credentials` R11; its named copy `attestingKeys` was removed once its callers re-pointed (K636 BOB-1; T21 N453))*
- **R71** `projectCreated({projectId, ownerId, visibility, by})` is what `promotion` calls when a promotion creates a project: it makes `ownerId` the sole initial owner (R31), records the creation visibility (R45's settings), and reindexes the project's sight, in the caller's transaction.
- **R72** *(retired: moved to `credentials` R2, K617, K637)*
- **R73** *(retired: moved to `credentials` R3, K617, K637)*

**participation(projectId, memberId) → `{state, owner}` or null** (K68)
- **R74** Answers one member's participation in one project: its state (`invited`, `joined`, `leaving`, or another state the roster holds) and whether the member is an owner; `null` when the member has none or the project is not held. Never throws. (Read by `promotion.forkProject`, R43.)

**rescueRefusal(projectId, by) → refusal or null; positionalMember(viewer, identity?) → member id or null** (N64, K91)
- **R75** `rescueRefusal` answers the first of `project-roster` R5's caller-and-project refusals that holds, in its order and byte for byte as its `projectOwnerRescue` answers it: `NOT_AN_ADMIN` (R84) unless `by` is an administrator (R64); `NO_OWNERS` when the project has no owner; `OWNERS_ARE_ACTIVE`, naming the active owners, unless every owner is inactive; otherwise `null`. It writes nothing and never throws. (Read by `affordances` for the rescue's fact, so the offer and the act cannot disagree.)
- **R76** `positionalMember` answers who is asking, as distinct from what they may see: R43's member id for `identity` when it is a non-empty string, else for `viewer`; `null` for a machine credential and for a viewer or identity R43 admits to nothing. It writes nothing and never throws. (Read by `retrieval`, `queue`, `affordances` and `legacy-store`.)

**existenceAct(projectId, viewer) → refusal or null** (N76)
- **R77** Answers `PROJECT_SEEN_NOT_A_PARTICIPANT` (C-70.1: the project's id and name only, with its check id and translation) when `viewer`'s sight of `projectId` is existence only (R43), else `null`; `null` when no `viewer` is given. When the viewer is an administrator (the founder included) at a hidden project's `EXISTENCE` (R44), and for that case only, C-70.1 also carries `owners`, the owners' current handles in R65's order (D54); for every other caller it carries no `owners` key. Every act of this module and of `promotion` that names a project asks it before its own no-such-project answer, so C-70.1 is minted only here. Never throws.

**noSuchProject(projectId, extra?) → refusal** (N208, N146, K238, K275; a module-level function)
- **R78** The one answer to one condition: no project answers to `projectId`, or the caller's sight of it is not `FULL` (after R77's existence answer), answered as absent (R61). It answers `{ok: false, reason: "NO_SUCH_PROJECT", code: "NO_SUCH_PROJECT", check, translation, project, detail}`: `project` the id as asked (null when none), `detail` one fixed sentence, the same for every caller (today's `#noSuchProject` sentence), and `check` and `translation` its catalogue row's. `extra` adds a caller's own fields (such as `finding`) and never replaces these. Every act of any module that answers this condition answers through it, so the code is minted at one site; its one catalogue row is this module's, its `where` naming this function, and intent's C-111.2 and conformance's C-113.2 give way to it. It writes nothing and never throws.

**notAnAdmin(by, act, extra?) → refusal** (N324, K275, K403; a module-level function)
- **R84** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R28, T51, K624, K3946)*

- **R79** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R25, T51, K624, K3946)*
- **R80** (N142, K285) `inSight(bundleId, viewer)`: `true` exactly when a bundle `bundleId` is held and R43 admits `viewer` to it (R44's FULL for a project); `false` for an absent or empty id, an unrecognised viewer, and a project R43 does not admit. Writes nothing, never throws. (`bundleGate` and `bundleRedactor` are not services: callers gate with R43 and R80.)

- **R96** *(retired: split; the `projectParticipants` figure is R114 here, the `projectOwnerVotes` figure `project-roster` R17; T38, N783)*
- **R114** (was R96's participation half; K861, `store-assembly` R100) The module exports a figure source shaped as `record-core` R63's `counts(hid)`, with its key list, for `store-assembly` to register under this module's name: `projectParticipants`, the rows of `project_participants`, less the rows whose `project_id` is in `hid`, a NULL key naming no bundle (so never dropped by `hid`); a null `hid` counts whole. The module registers nothing itself.

**Seams for `project-roster`** (N783)
- **R116** (N783, K624; R79's form) `onProjectInvited(module, fn)`: one later module (`project-roster`, its R15) registers once, at start; a malformed registration is refused `LISTENER_MALFORMED` and a second, whoever makes it, `LISTENER_DECLARED` naming the holder, both through R81. Each time R32 records an invitation, the registered `fn` is called once, inside that act and after its writes (in the caller's transaction), with `{projectId, memberId, by, at}` (`at` the act's time). When it answers a whole number of at least 1, R32's answer carries `request: "granted"`; otherwise the key is absent. With none registered, or a listener that throws or answers anything else, the invitation and its answer stand without the key.
- **R117** (N783, K624; R79's form) `onProjectHidden(module, fn)`: registered as R116 (`project-roster`, its R16). Each time R45 records the setting `hidden`, the registered `fn` is called once, inside that act and after its writes and the reindex (in the caller's transaction), with `{projectId, by, at}` (`at` the record's date). R45's answer then carries `requests_lapsed`, the whole number it answers, and 0 with none registered or a listener that throws or answers anything else; the setting and its record stand either way. Setting `discoverable` notifies nobody and its answer has no `requests_lapsed`.
- **R118** (N783) `participationWrite(kind, {projectId, memberId, by, comment, at})` writes one participation row in the caller's transaction and asks nothing (its caller's act has made every check): `invite` adds the member `invited`, not an owner, with `invited_by` = `by`; `ownerOn` sets an existing participant's owner flag, next in R65's order; `ownerOff` clears it, the member staying a participant; `rescue` makes the member a `joined` owner, next in R65's order, adding the row (`invited_by` = `by`, `comment`) when they hold none and changing no other row. `updated`, and `created` on a new row, is `at`. It answers true when it wrote, and false, writing nothing, for any other `kind`, for `invite` when the row exists, and for `ownerOn`/`ownerOff` when it does not; it never throws. (`project-roster` R3–R5 and R12 write through it.)
- **R119** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R48, T51, K624, K3946)*
- **R120** (N783; `record-core` R37's form) These tables and columns are a stated read contract: `members` (`member_id`, `handle`, `status`); `project_participants` (`project_id`, `member_id`, `state`, `owner`, `owner_order`, `comment`, `created`, and since T51 `invited_by`, the member R118 records as the inviter or rescuer, K3838); `project_sight` (`project_id`, `setting`); `project_visibility` (`seq`, `project_id`, `setting`, `set_by`, `reason`, `at`); `project_removals` (`seq`, `project_id`, `member_id`, `removed_by`, `comment`, `at`). A later module may join them in its own SQL (a projection bounded by SQL; `project-roster` R1, R2, R7–R14 read them), and this module changes no such column's name, type or meaning without a requirement change carried to every such reader (P5). No other column is part of the contract, and no later module writes these tables but through R118. (T41; D54) The sight they give is R43's: wherever this module, or a reader joining them, decides whether an administrator sees a project (R43's administrator and founder arms, R44 `sight`, R80 `inSight`), an administrator is admitted to a hidden project only when invited or joined to it; a migration rewrites the `project_sight` index, and anything indexed from it, to that rule, and changes no project's setting (R45). (T51; K3838; amends R120) `invited_by` joins the contract (a field added, no meaning changed).
- **R121** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R49, T51, K624, K3946)*

**notTheOwner(by, projectId) → refusal** (N812; K231; a module-level function)
- **R122** (K231; for `credentials` R54–R57) `notTheOwner(by, projectId)` is a module-level function: the one answer `PROJECT_ACT_NOT_THE_OWNER`, with its existing row, and shaped as R84's. Its row is C-56.2; its `where` moves to this function (a row change for T40-4).

**The words members read** (DEC-149; N664)
- **R112** (DEC-149, Bob's "S4: B"; K1779, K1785) Every member- or founder-facing string this module answers (the `translation` of each of its rows, every refusal's `detail`, `message` and `remedy`, and R108's statement) calls the group's own Civicsmith "your group's Civicsmith", or is reworded so it needs no name, and never "copy", "instance", "plane" or "server" for it ("the plane stamps who is asking" becomes "your group's Civicsmith takes who is asking from the signed-in session"; a possessive is turned round: "the founding administrator of your group's Civicsmith"). "Copy" keeps only its other meanings. The sweep's rows for this module (`build/plan/draft-T35-dec149-l1-l7.md`; `bio-plane/src/membership/` as numbered there) are `checks.mjs`:72, :73, :78, :80 (C-102.11, C-102.12), :236 (C-55.1), :318 (C-96.11) and `index.mjs`:139, :801, :2246, :2323, :2963 (R108's sentence): 11 rows, each applied where it lands and named by a test. Codes, op names, field names and comments are not member-facing and stay.
- **R133** (T47; K3037; `promotion` R39's row families, `answer-envelope`) The module exports its refusal-row tables, `MEMBERSHIP_CHECKS`, `MEMBER_ID_CHECKS`, `CUSTODIAL_CHECKS`, `PROJECT_AUTHORITY_CHECKS`, `PROJECT_VISIBILITY_CHECKS` and every other `*_CHECKS` table `index.mjs` exports: each a frozen map from a refusal code to its row `{check, where, translation}`, every code it mints answered by exactly one row across them (K231), read by `promotion`'s row census and `answer-envelope` and never written by them.

- **R140** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R56, T51, K624, K3946)*
- **R141** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R57, T51, K624, K3946)*
- **R142** (T47; K3078; MEMBERSHIP #37 J5) (1) `handleCheck`'s viewer arm answers a member's own current or earlier handle `taken`, as R16 and R123 hold for every other handle (handles are fixed for good, DEC-197); (2) R128's kept exception is spent: C-56.6 reads `refusal.PROJECT_GUARD_UNCHECKED` by key like every other row of R16 (DEC-198 (7)); (3) R61's and R78's "every act" is proven by a census test over `membershipOps`, never a sample. Test: each of the three, with a control.
- **R143** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R58, T51, K624, K3946)*
- **R144** *(retired: moved to `member-roster` R59, T51, K624, K3946)*

  On success it holds the handle and answers `{ok: true, handle}`. `founderHandle()` answers the held handle, or `null` while none is held. It writes nothing and never throws.

  From then on:
  - R16's and R123's `HANDLE_TAKEN` comparison also takes the founder's handle.
  - R92's `sessionRights("admin")` answers it as `handle`. So `credentials` R5 and `whoami` (`control-plane` R18) name it, `null` until one is held.
  - R141 reads: `admin` is the founder's internal member id only, the handle of no one, the founder included; `enroll`, `handleCheck` and `founderHandleSet` still refuse it as taken.

  The founder's member id stays `admin` everywhere: R43, R44, R64, R86 and R94 are unchanged, and no viewer, stamp, `author` or participation row changes. The held handle is exempt from purge, as R115's members are. The pre-auth answer of R132 still names no handle: its test fixture gains a founder handle.
  - Tests: an in-plane set by `admin` holds the handle, `sessionRights("admin").handle` answers it, and `handleCheck` answers it `taken`. Controls, one per refusal: `by` a member's id refused `FOUNDER_HANDLE_NOT_FOUNDER`; a second set refused `HANDLE_FIXED`, the first handle kept; `admin` and a member's earlier handle each refused `HANDLE_TAKEN`, `ADMIN` refused `BAD_HANDLE` (R16's order); `Bad Handle!` refused `BAD_HANDLE`. Also: `enroll` with the founder's handle is refused `HANDLE_TAKEN`, while a free handle enrols. The R132 census holds with the founder's handle in the store.

- **R149** (T50; N1186, K3557; amends R43, R44, R80, R88) **A viewer that carries a project.** `projectViewer(viewer, project)` (a module-level function) answers a viewer for `viewer` carrying `project`, in a form every service of this module that takes a viewer accepts (`viewerPredicate`, `sight`, `inSight`, `hiddenBundles`, `positionalMember`); `positionalMember` answers for it the member id of the viewer it was made from. For a `viewer` that names a member (`member:<id>`, the founder's included) and a `project` that is a non-empty string, `viewerPredicate` of the result admits a bundle exactly when R43 admits the member's own viewer to it and the bundle is in the project's reach: the project's own bundle; every bundle that belongs to it (`record-core` R34's `project`); and the bundles R150's registered readers add (its captures and the records it cites). A bundle outside the project's reach is not admitted though the member sees it, a record of another project and a record belonging to no project included; a bundle of the project the member herself may not see (R43) is not admitted either. `sight(projectId, viewer)` for such a viewer is the member's own sight of the carried project and `NONE` for any other, so no other project's existence is shown to it; `inSight` and `hiddenBundles` (R88) follow `viewerPredicate`, the complement spelled once. A `viewer` that names no member (a machine credential, one R43 admits to nothing) or a `project` that is not a non-empty string is answered `viewer` unchanged: a viewer with no project is exactly as R43 states. It writes nothing and never throws. Tests: for an active administrator, viewer carrying project A admits a record of A, A's own bundle, and a shared record A cites (through a stand-in reader, R150), and refuses a record of project B (discoverable, so the administrator otherwise sees it), a record belonging to no project that A does not cite, and, for a member not joined to a hidden A, a record of A; `sight` of B is `NONE`. Controls: `projectViewer` with no project, and a machine viewer with a project, answer the viewer unchanged and read as R43 states; the same member's plain viewer still admits B's record.
- **R150** (T50; N1186, K3557; R79's, R128's form) **The reach beyond a project's own records.** `registerProjectReach(module, fn)`: later modules register, once each, the reader that adds to a project's reach (R149) what this module's layer cannot read: `provenance` the captures its records hold, `connections` the records it cites. A malformed registration is refused `LISTENER_MALFORMED` and a second by the same module `LISTENER_DECLARED` naming it, both through R81. For a viewer carrying a project, R149 asks each registered `fn({project})`, in `MODULE_ORDER`, and takes the union of the bundle ids they answer; a reader that throws, or answers anything but a list of bundle ids, adds nothing (the reach narrows, never widens). With none registered the reach is the project's own bundle and the bundles belonging to it. An id a reader answers is admitted only if R43 admits the member's own viewer to it. This module never reads another module's tables to decide it. Test: two stand-in readers' ids are both admitted; a reader that throws adds nothing and does not change the other's; a reader's id the member cannot see under R43 is not admitted; a second registration by one module is refused; control: with none registered, only the project's own bundles are reached.
- **R151** (T50; N1116; K3366, K3368; DEC-257, DEC-258; `setup-words` R11–R13; amends every requirement here that quotes a member-facing sentence) **Words by key.** This module holds no member-facing English: every sentence it answers is read through `setup-words` `word(key, vars)`, and the module holds only keys. Its keys are the `reads` list for it in `docs/development/ux-substrate/screens/words-reads.json` (DEC-258), with any key a requirement here names. A sentence an earlier requirement here quotes (R84's `detail`, R108's statement, R123's `words`) means the key whose English it is: the quotation identifies the key and binds no wording, so a word changed in `words.json` changes no requirement and no code here. Where that list notes that a key's existing words govern over this module's own wording (`refusal.CONSENSUS_REQUIRED`, `refusal.NO_COVER`, `refusal.PROJECT_VISIBILITY_NOT_THE_OWNER`), the key's words govern. The strings that list marks `unkeyed` (none read by a member, each with its reason) stay in source. Test: each key it reads is asserted with `setup-words` `hasWord`; over fixtures, what it answers for a sample of its keys equals `word(key, vars)`; no test holds a sentence's English.

- **R154** (T51; CR-4; K624, K3946; the split map `build/extraction/membership-split-T51.md` §4) **Each moved name answers what `member-roster` answers.** `Membership` builds `membersOf(ctx)` and each name whose requirement moved to `member-roster` (the ids retired above) is a delegate of the same name and shape, and so is each public name `member-roster` adds later (T51 FR-66: `endorsementsOwed`, `expertiseAwaitingConfirmation` and `expertiseWithdraw`, its R77–R79; K3268), which `Membership` borrows from nowhere; `membership/index.mjs` re-exports `listenerRefusal`, `notAnAdmin`, `noSuchMember`, `MODULE_ORDER`, `moduleOrderFrom` and the `*_CHECKS` tables (the union of its own rows and `member-roster`'s, each code one row), and keeps `Membership.ROOT_ADMIN`, `CAPABILITIES`, `adminMath` and the other statics as aliases; `membershipOps` answers `member-roster`'s ops beside its own, so no user re-points (K3268). `viewerPredicate` (R76) reads the viewer's spelling through `member-roster` R73. Test: for each moved name, and each of the three above, the delegate and `member-roster` answer the same over one store (a read equal, a write read back by the module, a refusal byte for byte); a user's import of a re-exported name still resolves. Control: no code is minted at two sites (K231).

## Private

### Uses

- `setup-words`: `word`, `hasWord` (R151, T50; K3366, K3368).
- `record-core`: a bundle's existence, type and title by id, and the project bundles (record-core R34, R35); `declarePurge` (R21), `registerAuditFinding` (R68).
- `record-grammar`: `isMachineIdentity` and `MACHINE_CLASS_PREFIX`.
- `signatures` is a permitted dependency; nothing in this module's share calls it.

- **R59** *(retired: split; members, expertise, votes, participation, visibility and the sight index are R115 here, owner votes and requests `project-roster` R18; T38, N783)*
- **R115** (was R59's membership half) Members, expertise and votes are declared exempt from `purge` (credentials, sessions, keys and AI credentials are `credentials`', its R18); participation, visibility and the sight index (with the removals R36 records) are keyed by project and cleared with it.
- **R60** An administrator's sight of a project is never a position in one; the only project act an administrator holds is `project-roster` R5. Acts an administrator holds that must reach a hidden project without its contents stay reachable at `EXISTENCE` (R44; D54): `project-roster` R5 (the rescue, Membership §7.13), and the hold reads and notices of DEC-113 (`actions` R58 `projectHolds`, R59 `holdsReleased`, `purgeHeld` R60), answered at `EXISTENCE` with what each already names (the project's id and hold state), never its contents. (D54; Membership §7.3; K2484) The hold's acts reach it there too: `actions` R52 `actionHold`, R56 `actionHoldRelease` and R57 `holdReleasePreview`, naming the project's id and hold state only; built by membership in T42 (N833).
- **R61** Every act naming a project the caller cannot see answers byte for byte as an id that names nothing, and sight is asked before position.
- **R91** *(retired: moved to `credentials` R19, K617, K637)*
- **R132** (REC-41, D-188; T47: N989, K3027; held by `members.test.mjs`, this module's) The pre-auth `bootstrap` answer (`op=bootstrap`, reached with no credential: `instance-setup` R17, R80, R81, with `credentials` R2's state) tells a stranger nothing about who the members are. Asked with no credential, on a store holding a founder and members with passwords: (1) no key or value, at any depth, names a role, member id or handle held there, matched as a substring of each key and value; (2) no value is an ISO-8601 instant but `consumedAt`, the instance's own claim time; (3) the answer holds no nested object or array, at any key; (4) its key set is exactly `bootstrapConfigured`, `claimed`, `consumedAt`, `ok`, `rearmed`, `service`, `storeVersion`, `version`, `test_instance`, `part_signin`, `part_scanner`, `part_safe_view`, each of the last four a scalar (`true`, `false` or `null`). A new key is admitted only by naming it here; none of (1)–(3) is widened. The test proves the roster exists through `memberlist` before asserting the answer withholds it. (Red until `instance-setup`'s T47-75 answers `parts` as the three flat keys, K3027.)

### Suggestions

- **Sight moves here.** `viewerPredicate` lives in `query.mjs` (`query-language`, layer 5) but reads this module's tables and is §7.9's rule; it moves here and `query-language` gains a use of `membership`.
- **Fork and export are not this module's.** `forkProject` (store.mjs 37041) writes the clone through `promote`, a later module, so it moves to `promotion` (K31), which asks this module's fence and calls R31; §7.12's rules (joined forker holding `create_projects`, a new name, sole owner, no participants copied, `derived_from` recorded, `forming`, no inherited visibility) go into promotion's file. `exportManifest`/`exportLog` (37180–37257) read `register` and `refs` (K23: provenance and connections), so they move to `publication` with `export_log` (K31, entry N16).
- **Project name uniqueness** (`projectNameKey`, `checkProjectNameUniqueness`, C-77) serves promotion's write path; it goes with fork. Canon §7.1 requires NFC normalisation, not built and in no old-plan row.
- **Capabilities are enforced at the op layer** (the control plane's needs table), not here: `projectfork` needs `create_projects`, and §11 item 8b asks that a capability absent from the interface is also refused there.
- **D-586** is fixed where the scope is judged (`aiReachesAsMember`, `index.mjs` 3454, control-plane; `admission` R13 since the split, K624): the mint must refuse ops only a session performs. This module records the scope it is handed.
- **Callers' obligations.** `promotion` calls R31 only for a creation stamped with a member, so a machine-created project has no owner (§7.1); it gates deactivation and reactivation (§7.11) on `isProjectOwner`, and every revision of a project's document, citations, stance, conclusion and feed judgements on R55.
- **Stale comments (TRANSITION C8).** `schema.mjs` line 215 and `bio-plane/test/membership.test.mjs`'s header cite `BIO_Membership_Architecture_v1.md`; repoint to v2. Also stale: the `project_participants` comment (store.mjs ~1690) saying removal is administrators' (v1.4 §7.7; §11 item 5 requires correction) and `#isProjectOwner`'s saying 7.13 is not built.
- `memberAdd` still accepts `name` as an alias of `cover`; drop it at extraction.
- **The browser-held key** (R89; K509 (2)). The key is made on the member's own device, never by another, non-extractable, and each use is confirmed by passphrase or device unlock. That is the interface's to keep; the plane cannot test it. The plane already verifies an Ed25519 WebCrypto key's signatures (`sshsig.mjs`), so R89 needs no new verification.
- **T34's callers (DEC-132 to DEC-136).** `admission` routes R101 and R104 and authenticates nothing beyond what they check; the website keeps the key on its server and sends the link (the setup screen says so, DEC-133 (4)). the interface's setup steps (`screens-entry`; was `setup-page` R15–R17) ask R11's record and R107's choice at setup, give the one-time recommendation of a second administrator and the statement of dependence (DEC-134 (2), (6)), and offer R109 as a side trip. `tasks` reads R106 for "Ask for a check" and reads R24 for the check's confirmation state. `publication` shows R110's public answer only, behind the outward-act warning, which is the screen's at the moment `public` is chosen (DEC-132 (3)); `bias` offers R110 as a starting draft. The other first-time statements (DEC-136 (1): a note, an observation, a source's identity, a hidden project, one's own ties) belong to the modules that hold those things and read R107.
- **Size (P6).** If R97–R111 would take the module past about 4,000 lines, R107 and R109–R110 (the group's settings) move to a new home before the job adds more (plan T34-10; a new module is Bob's).
- **T35 (T35-14).** The rows whose translation R112 moves (C-55.1, C-96.11, C-102.11, C-102.12) await promotion's stamp (T35-16). DEC-149's term entry ("Your group's Civicsmith: Civicsmith installed in a Cloudflare account your group controls. …") is not a string this module serves; it is the glossary's, held by the screens. Size (P6): 3,966 lines on `tranche/T35`; the job reports any growth (plan T35, BOB's review 4).
- **T48 (T48-9).** R143's mark is the Home's (`screens-daily`, N1036); its op, a write by the viewer's own session, is `op-declarations`' and `control-plane`'s, and what members did since the mark is read from each area's own module. No module held such a mark at T48's fold (`queue`'s `queue_state.last_seen` is a per-case re-notify anchor, not a look at Home); the job re-tests that at START (K3189) and, if one is found, R143 is withdrawn rather than built.
- `project_sight` is a derived index, rebuilt at boot, at every promotion of a project and at every R45; promotion calls a reindex service here.
- **T50 (T50-2).** R146: the constant may be generated at build from the file, as `rows.mjs` is from its source, with `moduleOrderFrom` exported so a test can hand it a changed copy; a plane bundled for the Worker cannot read the file at run time. R149: a spelling such as `member:<id>@<projectId>` keeps the old pattern's reading of `member:<id>` intact only if no member id can contain the separator (member ids are `a-z0-9-`, R12), and every module that reads a viewer's member id should ask `positionalMember` (R76), never parse the string. R149/R150 sit in layer 2 while captures (`provenance`, layer 3) and citations (`connections`) are above it, so the reach is a registration, as R128's guard is; the SQL of the fence is `viewerPredicate`'s, composed with the reach as a bounded set (a temporary list or a join), the job's choice. R148 completes R143's note (T48): `lookedAt` serves Find's "new since" (`retrieval` `browse`) without moving Home's mark. R147: the founder has no roster row, so the row is built beside the table's rows and placed first.

- **R155** (T51; K4168; the T51 declaration pass; op-declarations R80, R81; op-grades R49, R50; test-support R15) **The module declares the ops it serves that the screens send.** `DECLARED_OPS` is exported beside the ops map: a frozen object keyed by the op's door name, each row `{classes, machineClasses?, mutating, weight, description, fields: {accepts, requires}}`, its class, weight and description copied from the op's existing rows and its fields read from the arm whole (the stamps and the shell's `reason` are not accepts unless the arm reads a `reason` of its own): `projectinvite`, `projectjoin`, `projectleave`, `projectremove`, `projectvisibilityset`. Test: `declaredOpHolds` for each, with only its requires, without each, and with a field outside its accepts (`declared-ops.test.mjs`).
