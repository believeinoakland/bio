# ocr-worker — requirements

**Status** · In force: written by BOB #37 (T6), a helper module, its requirements BOB's (K20). Every requirement met. Changed in T51 fix round 9 (BOB; K4831, K4834, K4837: R7, R25 amended; R26-R31 new; marked not yet met T51).

## Public

### Purpose

A standalone Cloudflare Worker, reached only through the plane's `OCR_WORKER` service binding. Given
a capture's sha, a store namespace and a set of page numbers, it reads the captured bytes from R2
itself, renders one page to pixels, runs a wasm OCR engine over the frame, and answers with
line-grain text, each line carrying the pixel rectangle a reader can check it against and the
engine's own confidence — or a named refusal, leaving the document honestly unread. It holds no
record, writes nothing, and reports the running build's own version.

### Provides

**POST /transcribe** (also answered at the bare path `POST /`) — body `{capture_sha, store, pages}` →
`{ok, ...}`.

- **R1** `capture_sha` must be exactly 64 hex characters (case-insensitive; normalised to lower
  case before use). Anything else is refused `BAD_SHA` (400), checked before the store or the pages.
- **R2** `store` must be present and a string, or the request is refused `BAD_STORE` (400) — the
  condition is exactly "no namespace was named", whether the field is absent or of another type.
- **R3** A named `store` that is not exactly `"bio"` or `"scratch"` (case-sensitive) is refused
  `NAMESPACE_UNKNOWN` (400), naming what was asked (`asked`, truncated to 80 characters) and the two
  names that exist (`namespaces`). This is refused before the R2 bucket is addressed at all, even
  when bytes sit under that exact key — the fence is the NAME, not whether the bucket holds
  something there. The
  two names this module accepts are fixed in its own source; a caller depending on them matching the
  record's namespace set relies on that set not changing without this module changing too.
- **R4** `pages` must be a non-empty array, or the request is refused `BAD_PAGES` (400). An array
  that is non-empty but names no non-negative integer (after de-duplication) is refused the same way,
  from inside the chunk rule (R6).
- **R5** With no `CAPTURES` R2 binding configured, every call is refused `R2_NOT_CONFIGURED` (503),
  checked before the body is even read. Otherwise the bytes are read at key
  `${store}/captures/${sha}`; none found there is refused `NOT_FOUND` (404), naming `capture_sha` and
  `store`. `NOT_FOUND` and `NAMESPACE_UNKNOWN` are never each other: a namespace that does not exist
  is refused by name before any read, and only a namespace that exists can answer `NOT_FOUND`.
- **R6** Exactly ONE page is transcribed per call: the lowest distinct non-negative integer named in
  `pages`. The rest of the distinct integers named, sorted ascending, are returned in the top-level
  `deferred` array and are not attempted — this member never loops over several pages in one
  invocation. `notes` explains why whenever `deferred` is non-empty, citing the measured memory
  bound and that transcribing a whole document in one call is unmeasured.
- **R7** The one page taken is refused, in this order — the first condition that applies is the one
  reported, and a page failing an earlier condition is never evaluated against a later one:
  1. `ENGINE_ABSENT` (200, `ok:false`) — the wasm core or the language model did not load as the
     measured pair (checked before any bytes are touched).
  2. `PAGE_NOT_RENDERABLE` (200) — the page renderer (`pdf-pixels`) refused it; this member forwards
     that refusal's own reason rather than reinterpreting it (`IMAGE_TOO_LARGE`, `PIXELS_UNDETERMINED` and the others of `pdf-pixels`' set alike).
  3. `PIXELS_UNREADABLE` (200) — the renderer answered in a container this member cannot read at all
     (anything other than `image/png`).
  4. `FRAME_OVER_MEASURED_BOUND` (200) — the page's RGBA frame (`width * height * 4` bytes) exceeds
     `MAX_FRAME_BYTES` (quoted from `READ_BOUNDS`, `boundOf("ocr", "frame_bytes")`: the alpha column holds 61,300,000, the largest frame CPDF-15 measured completing on the deployed
     runtime; no numeric literal of the module's own); the refusal names `width`, `height`, `frame_bytes` and `bound_bytes`. Checked only
     once the container has passed step 3, so a page too large is refused by its true reason even
     when its container would also have been unreadable. (Fix round 9, G125g) The frame is first judged from its declared size, before the renderer is called and so before anything is rendered: the page box at the render resolution, or the picture's header grown by R24's preparation; when that judgment applies, the answer is this step's, reported after step 1, and a page over the bound costs no render. A frame exactly at the bound is read and one pixel over is refused; the prepared frame, which may pass the 4096 edge, is judged at its true size. The rendered frame is judged again as before.
  5. `PIXELS_UNREADABLE` again (200) — the PNG this member did receive is a shape its own reader
     refuses (interlaced, an unsupported colour-type/bit-depth pair, a scanline filter it does not
     implement, or truncated data). Same reason code as step 3, reached only once the frame has
     passed the size check.
  6. `ENGINE_FAILED` (200) — the engine threw or refused on this frame; the refusal carries the
     engine's own error name and message.
  7. `NOTHING_TRANSCRIBED` (200) — the engine boxed no region carrying both non-blank text and a
     finite rectangle. This is answered exactly the same way for a blank page and for a page of pure
     noise: an engine that answers nothing on either is reporting a finding, not failing, and the
     refusal names how many boxes it found and how many were blank or unanchored.
  Beside these (K4868): `PAGE_NOT_LEGIBLE` (200, `ok:false`) is R25's refusal of a page under its legibility floor; `UNEXPECTED_FAILURE` (200, `ok:false`, with `stage` and `error_name`) is R28's answer to a throw anywhere in the call; `BAD_PSM` (503) is R29's refusal of an instance setting that names no page segmentation mode, an instance's fault and never a document finding.
  Every one of these is a document-level finding and is answered `200` with `ok:false`, never an
  HTTP error status — only a malformed request (R1–R4), an unconfigured binding (R5) or a capture
  genuinely absent (R5) uses a non-200 status.
- **R8** A successful answer (`ok:true`) carries, at minimum: `engine` ("tesseract-wasm"), `version`
  ("0.11.0"), `model` ("tessdata_fast/eng"), `cap` (the fixed letter `"C"`, never any other value —
  an OCR pass never earns a higher capture grade), `measured_by` (a string naming the one measurement
  `cap` and the confidence basis rest on, and its stated reach — never a default and never invented
  per request), `confidence_floor` (the instance's `OCR_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR`, read as a number in
  `0..1`, or `null` when it is absent, empty or out of range — `null` is a statement that no
  threshold has been measured, not an omission), `grain` (`"line"`), `deferred` (R6), `image`
  (`{width, height, frame_bytes, route, upright, rotate_deg, dpi, pixels_sha256, turned_deg}` of the rendered
  frame; `turned_deg` is what the renderer says it turned, R26), `notes` (an array of strings, possibly empty), and `pages`: an array of exactly one
  `{page, regions}`.
- **R9** Each region in `regions` carries: `text` (a non-blank string), `source` (`{kind:"pdf-page",
  ref:"p<page>", page, rect:[left,top,right,bottom]` — four finite numbers, pixel coordinates of the
  frame that was OCR'd — `space:"image-px"`, and `image:{width,height,route,upright,rotate_deg,
  pixels_sha256}}`), and `confidence` — either `{value, basis:"engine"}` with `value` in `0..1` when
  the engine's own character-level decode rated the region, or the literal string `"none"` when it
  did not. No other basis is ever reported, and no value is substituted, rescaled or invented for a
  region the engine did not rate.
- **R10** A region the engine returned with no non-blank text, or with a rectangle that is not four
  finite numbers, is dropped from `regions` and counted rather than kept — never recorded as text
  with no anchor.

**GET /version** → `{ok:true, name:"ocr-worker", version, engine, engine_version, model,
engine_loaded, engine_unavailable?}`.

- **R11** `version` is read from the running build's own `env.VERSION` — never a value compiled into
  the source — so it names the code actually answering, not the code last deployed.
- **R12** `engine`, `engine_version` and `model` name the OCR engine this build carries
  ("tesseract-wasm", "0.11.0", "tessdata_fast/eng"), because this member's output is graded and
  which engine answered is part of which build answered.
- **R13** `engine_loaded` is asked, not assumed: it is `true` only when the wasm core arrived as a
  compiled `WebAssembly.Module` and the language model's byte length matches the measured pair; when
  it is `false`, `engine_unavailable` names why. A member deployed without its wasm part answers
  every other route normally and is caught here rather than on the first page asked of it.

**Any other method or path.**

- **R14** Refused `{ok:false, reason:"UNKNOWN"}` with HTTP 404.

- **R23** (T50; N1191 (c); JOURNEYS V4 B-30; pdf-pixels R42) A capture whose bytes are a JPEG or PNG picture, not a PDF, is transcribed as a one-page document: page `0` is rendered with the picture renderer (`pdf-pixels` R42, `renderPictureToPixels`) instead of the page renderer and then taken through R7's refusals and R8 onward exactly as a PDF page is, the same fields answered; any other page number named for a picture is refused `NO_SUCH_PAGE` naming it; a picture the renderer refuses answers `PAGE_NOT_RENDERABLE` with its reason (R7 step 2). A PDF is transcribed as before. Test: a fixture photograph of a printed sentence answers its words for page 0 with R8's fields; page 1 of it is `NO_SUCH_PAGE`; control: a PDF page is unchanged, and bytes that are neither are refused as today.

- **R24** (T51; FR-67; K4194, L26) A photographed page is made ready before the engine reads it: the picture renderer is asked for page 0 with `prepare: true` (`pdf-pixels` R44: light levelled, tilt turned level, small print enlarged), so the engine reads the prepared pixels, and every field of R8 and R9 describes the prepared frame (`image`, `source.image`, the rectangles and `pixels_sha256` are those of the prepared samples). R7's bound (step 4) is judged on the prepared frame's size, which the renderer answers, a picture of 110 dpi growing about 2.5 times, never on the size of the capture's own picture. A picture whose answer says `prepared.text_found` is `false` (a blank wall, noise: no text lines in it) is not handed to the engine: it is answered `NOTHING_TRANSCRIBED` (R7 step 7) with `boxes`, `blank` and `unanchored` all 0, after the container and the bound have passed and before the engine runs. A PDF page is rendered and read exactly as before (R23's control). Test: through the member's real path, with the real picture renderer and the real engine, the photographs of `fixtures/` read at least 90 percent of their words prepared, where the same member asked without `prepare` reads under 90 percent; the blank picture is answered `NOTHING_TRANSCRIBED` and the engine never runs; control: the old answer without `prepare`.
- **R25** (T51 fix round 2, C18; K4316; amends R7, R8; fix round 9, G137d; K4831 (10)) **Every page's reading says how legible it was, a PDF page's as a picture's.** An ok answer, for a picture capture and for a PDF page alike, carries `legibility {words, confident_words, share}`, a confident word being one the engine rated 0.6 or over; a share under 0.8 adds a notes sentence that the page is only partly legible and keeps its text; a share under 0.2 is refused with the legibility and no text kept, `PICTURE_NOT_LEGIBLE` for a picture and `PAGE_NOT_LEGIBLE` for a PDF page (each an answer with `ok: false`), a step after the engine runs and after R26's turn has been tried; an engine that gave no words states none. Test: a clear picture and a clear PDF page answer a share at or over 0.8 and no note; a blurred one under 0.8 the note; an unreadable one is refused with its legibility; an inverted, a blank, a handwritten and a faint page get the same answer as a picture and as a PDF page (SCAN B3, B8, B9).
- **R26** (fix round 9, G132m, G137d; K4831 (10)) **A page found turned is turned upright first.** For every frame, picture or PDF page, the engine's orientation is asked before its text is read. A frame found turned by 90, 180 or 270 degrees is asked again from the renderer with `turn` (`pdf-pixels` R48) and read upright: `image` carries `turned_deg`, and the rectangles, `source.image` and `pixels_sha256` are those of the turned frame. (K4868) Because the engine's orientation is unreliable below a full-resolution page, a turn it asks for is tried only when the page as it lies is not clearly legible (under 0.8, or nothing read) or its boxed lines run up the frame (their median width under their height), and is kept only when the turned page rates at least as many words as reading it as it lies; a clearly legible page with its lines across the frame is never turned, and no legible page is read four ways. (fix round 10, cause 7; K5053) A page that would otherwise be refused (nothing read, or under R25's 0.2 after the turn above) may be read a further way: each of the other quarter turns is tried and the best-rated reading is kept, so an upright sparse page whose orientation the engine states wrongly is read upright, never turned the wrong way and refused; the exception is for such a page only. A frame whose orientation the engine cannot tell is read as it is and `notes` states that its orientation could not be determined; it is never read as garbage and answered `ok:true` with no mention. A page still under R25's 0.2 after being turned is refused as R25 says. Test: SCAN B1, B2 (a page turned 90, 180 and 270 as PNG, as JPEG without EXIF, and inside a PDF with and without `/Rotate`): read upright at the legibility floor, or stated; control: an upright page is not turned (`turned_deg` 0). Test (fix round 10): a one-page picture of three lines of text, upright and turned 90, 180 and 270 degrees, and a two-page scan of three-line pages rotated 90 degrees: each is `ok` with `turned_deg` the upright turn (0 for the upright page) and `legibility.share` at least 0.5.
- **R27** (fix round 9, G132k; F-5) **A call reads its page's bytes, not the file's.** The bytes read from R2 for one call are the cross-reference data, that page's objects and its image stream (`pdf-pixels` R47), so across the up to 24 calls of a document the bytes read per page are bounded by the page and not by the size of the capture; counted by the ranges `CAPTURES.get` is asked for.
- **R28** (fix round 9, G132j; N23) **A top-level guard.** Whatever throws inside a call once R1–R5 have accepted it (the renderer, the picture renderer, the PNG reader, the inflater, R2) is answered 200 `ok:false` with the reason `UNEXPECTED_FAILURE`, `stage` (which step) and the error's name, a document-level finding like R7's, never a 5xx and never a thrown error. Test: SCAN D11, a throwing renderer and a throwing R2 each answer 200 with the named reason.
- **R29** (fix round 9, G125g) An `OCR_PSM` that is set and is not a page-segmentation mode the engine accepts is refused on every call `BAD_PSM` (503), naming the value (truncated to 80 characters), checked with R5 before the body is read; it is never accepted silently.
- **R30** (fix round 9, G132i; N13) **A page routed here is read though it shows text.** A page the plane sends to this member has been judged to need OCR (a folio on a scanned page, a stamp): the page renderer is asked with `allowTextPage: true`, so it is never refused `PAGE_HAS_TEXT_LAYER` (`pdf-pixels` R16), and the OCR text is returned for the plane to append to the text already held. Test: a scanned page carrying a printed folio is transcribed, not refused.

## Private

### Uses

- `runtime-limits`: `READ_BOUNDS` and `boundOf(kind, name)` for `MAX_FRAME_BYTES` (R7), the one ceiling this module keeps (R31).
- `pdf-pixels` (K70): `renderPageToPixels(source, page, {decodeDct:true})`, its first argument the bytes or a range source `{size, readRange(offset, length)}` over the capture (R27; K4868) → `{ok:true, bytes, route,
  mediaType, width, height, upright, rotate_deg, pixels_sha256, page_geometry}` or a named refusal
  (a text layer, vector marks, several images on one page, an undecodable container, and others).
  This module always asks for `decodeDct:true` and, for a page the plane routed to it, `allowTextPage:true` (R30), and forwards a refusal's `reason` verbatim as
  `PAGE_NOT_RENDERABLE`'s own reason; it does not reinterpret or renumber pdf-pixels' refusal set.
- `setup-words`: `word`, `localize` (the words rule: a sentence people read is read by key; K3930, K3943, K3949).

### Invariants

- **R15** Writes nothing. No call to `.put`, `.delete`, `.createMultipartUpload` or
  `.resumeMultipartUpload` appears anywhere in this module's own sources, it holds no `STORE`
  (Durable Object) or `PUBLISHED` binding — so it structurally cannot write the record — and the
  bucket it reads from is byte-for-byte unchanged, object-for-object, after any sequence of calls.
- **R16** The namespace set this module will read from is exactly `["bio", "scratch"]`, case-
  sensitive, fixed in its own source; a name outside it is refused (R3) before the R2 bucket is ever
  addressed, even when bytes already sit under that exact key. This set names the same two namespaces the
  record it reads from actually holds — a caller extending the record's namespace set without this
  module's set moving too is a defect in this module's copy, not a defect in the request.
  (D-478, C-78.1's rule extended to every fleet member — see Suggestions.)
- **R17** The only confidence basis this module ever reports is the literal string `"engine"` or the
  literal string `"none"` — never a model's self-reported opinion of itself, and never a value
  rescaled or invented from one the engine did not produce.
- **R18** No production beyond what the engine's own decode produced: no spell-correction, no
  dictionary pass, no joining of hyphenated lines, no cleanup of any kind. Output text is exactly
  what the decoder decoded.
- **R19** The engine's identity (`ENGINE_NAME`, `ENGINE_VERSION`, `MODEL_NAME`) and the wasm/model
  byte sizes it was measured at (`WASM_BYTES`, `MODEL_BYTES`) are fixed constants, and the
  committed `assets/` core and model are exactly that long. Before any page is processed (R13) the
  member checks what it can observe: the core loaded as a compiled `WebAssembly.Module` and the
  model's length equals `MODEL_BYTES`, refusing `ENGINE_ABSENT` otherwise. The core's exact bytes
  are pinned before deploy by the bundle manifest's hash of `assets/tesseract-core.wasm` (bundler
  R4, R6). So a member serving different engine bytes than its `cap` was measured on refuses
  rather than answering under that `cap`.
- **R20** No place is named in this module's behaviour, and no requirement above depends on which
  jurisdiction the document belongs to; the same inputs (bytes, page, namespace, engine settings)
  produce the same class of answer for any capture, in any instance. The one place-name in this
  module's source is a citation of the measurement `cap` and `measured_by` rest on (a specific
  ground-truthed page), never a fact its behaviour branches on.
- **R21** The wire answer is a pure function of the bytes read for the named capture, the page
  requested, and the two instance settings (`OCR_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR`, `OCR_PSM`); this module holds no
  state between calls, reads the record only through `CAPTURES.get`, and makes no other network or
  storage call.
- **R22** The module exports, from its engine-free contract, `PLANE_OPS` (`{op: {mutating, why}}`, the plane ops it calls: empty, since it calls none) and `NAMESPACES` (R16's set), both frozen; control-plane pins them against its op table and its namespace gate, which is how a record namespace set moved without this module's (R16) is caught. (N402, K631)
- **R31** (fix round 9, G124; K4835 (1)) No numeric literal in this module's code is a ceiling it keeps (`MAX_FRAME_BYTES`): it is read from `READ_BOUNDS`, and a test reads the module's `src` and finds none.

### Satisfies

- `BIO_Content_Framework_v0_10.md` §16, "How content is extracted today" — the non-text path's tier
  3 and the OCR producer contract the plane's consumer (`ocrTextFromMember`,
  `bio-plane/src/index.mjs`) refuses on.
- `BIO_Distribution_v0_1.md` (whole) — the fleet-member rules this module is held to: it writes
  nothing, it versions and rolls out on its own, and `GET /version` reports the build actually
  running rather than a compiled-in constant.
- DEC-35 (`docs/development/DECISIONS.md`) — the in-account path is the default for Tier-3 OCR, and
  the plane and `pdf-worker` are ruled out as its home by bundle size, which is why this exists as
  its own fleet member.
- DEC-42 (`docs/development/DECISIONS.md`) — wasm tesseract named as the engine.
- `build/layers.md`, "No jurisdiction in the product" (R20).

### Suggestions

- The memory bound (`MAX_FRAME_BYTES`, the alpha column of `READ_BOUNDS`, 61,300,000) and the one-page-per-invocation rule are both
  measured facts (CPDF-15, `MEASUREMENTS.md` 2026-09-10, on the deployed runtime), not defaults; a
  runtime or engine change should re-measure rather than assume the same figure holds.
- The namespace set (R16) is carried as a copy of the record's own set because a fleet member cannot
  import the plane's source; a job that changes either set should change both in the same act
  (D-478 is where this was last found stale).
- `env.OCR_PSM`, when set, is passed to the engine as its page-segmentation mode. The response does
  not echo it back, so a valid value is not independently testable at the interface beyond "the call is
  threaded through and does not crash the request"; an invalid one is refused (R29).
- Discarding a region below `confidence_floor` is the CALLER's job (`applyConfidenceFloor` in
  `bio-plane/src/textchain.mjs`), never this module's: this module states the floor it was given and
  never applies it itself, so the discard rule exists in exactly one place.
- The caller (the plane) is the one that loops over a request's `deferred` pages, one invocation per
  page, within its own per-request budget (D-606); this module's contract is unaffected by how many
  times it is called in a row.
- `measured_by`'s exact string is worth pinning byte-for-byte in a test (as `ocr-worker.test.mjs`
  already does against `contract.mjs`'s own constant) rather than pattern-matched, so a rewritten
  measurement citation is caught as a change rather than passing a loose regex.
