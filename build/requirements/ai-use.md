# ai-use — requirements

**Status** · In force: a new module (layer 6, directly before `ai-runs`; K657, K1043), its requirements BOB's, written for T40 from `build/plan/draft-T40-N812.md` part C (N812; Bob's K2350, K2352, K2353; adopted K2373, its doubts settled K2376; applied K2394). R1–R4 were `ai-runs` R48–R51, retired there with pointers (B10). Last changed T40 (T40-7: R1–R9 new; N812; K2373, K2376, K2394, K2400). Last changed T41 (T41-22: R10 `estimate`, R11 `actualOf`, new; R4 and R9 amended, folded with T40's text, D12; as `draft-T41-investigation.md` §3.6, K2405, K2418), not yet met; every requirement not yet met (T41). Last changed T42 (T42-17: R2 and R3 amended, `ai_ceilings` dropped after the carry and the owner's `explore` read through `credentials.accountUsesOf`; N848, N831; K2592, K2608), not yet met. Last changed T43 (T43-11: R3 amended, the unjudged refusal; R13 amended, every fill read by key, `AI_USE_WORDS` equal to `words.json`, `ai.use.transcribe.*`; Terms, the nine use kinds; N856, N862; DEC-189, DEC-190; K2689), not yet met. Last changed T44 (T44-7: R8, R13 amended, C-143.5 and C-143.6 by key, all nine uses; `LIMIT_PERIOD_FILL`, `LIMIT_WHEN_FILL`, `MONTH_NAMES` deleted; N859, N869, N871, N876; K2650, K2719, K2720), not yet met. T47 (T47-70: R13's text unchanged; the job re-takes the DEC-198/DEC-199 words it reads, N992, K3022; a Suggestions note only). Last changed T48 (T48-29: R14 new, an account's use over thirty days and per period against each limit, summed and naming no member, carried from ai-accounts' L2 draft (`draft-T48-L6-carry.md`), N1026, DEC-215 (1), K3138, K3198; `USE_KINDS`, `accountUses`, `accountUsesOf`, `aiKeptAway` and `projectsKeptAway` read from `ai-accounts`, `credentials` dropped from its uses, its tests following, N996 §5; the citations in Purpose, Terms, R2, R3, R6, R12 re-pointed, meaning unchanged; K3195); marked not yet met (T48). Last changed T50 (T50-69: R15; K3637); marked not yet met (T50).

**Size (P6).** About 900 lines: about 350 copied from `ai-runs/index.mjs`:2591–2940 (the counter, the ceilings and the reads, K624), with the limits, the judging and the reads added. Well under 4,000.

## Public

### Purpose

What each AI account has spent and may spend. It counts each use against the account that paid and the member whose act it was, holds each account owner's money limits, judges a use against them, and answers each owner its own use and each member theirs. It holds no credential, and it does not choose which account pays (that is `ai-accounts`').

### Provides

Terms. An **owner** is the holder of one AI account: `group` (its administrators act), `project:<id>` (any one of its owners acts) or `member:<id>` (that member alone acts) (`ai-accounts` R10, R11, R14). A **use** is an `ai-accounts.USE_KINDS` entry, its R14's nine (`ask`, `draft`, `run`, `standing`, `explore`, `enquire`, `read`, `transcribe`, `account`; T43, N862, DEC-190). A **limit** is `{owner, scope, unit, period, amount, inclusive}`. A **period** is the current local `day` or `month` of the group's calendar (`civil-time`); a month's limit resets on the 1st. With no limit set, nothing is capped here (a provider's own spend limit answers as `ai-runs` states). `viewer` and `by` are the control plane's stamps. Every refusal names `code` and carries its row's `check` and `translation` (R8).

**Counting** (`countUsage`)
- **R1** (was `ai-runs` R48, R49; B8) `countUsage({owner, member, use, mode, model, usage, calls, at})` is called in the caller's transaction.
  - `owner` is `group`, `project:<id>` or `member:<id>`.
  - `usage` is `agent-model` R5's shape plus `estimated_cost_usd` (its R13).
  - It adds to the counter `ai_usage`, kept per owner, member, local day (`civil-time.localDay`) and `use`: the token sums, `calls` (a `null` counted as one), and `estimated_cost_usd`. `countAskUsage({member, mode, usage, calls, at})` (was `ai-runs` R48's; K2400) counts an ask or a draft (no run) the same way, with `mode` `ask` or `draft` and its owner as `accountFor` answered it; any other `mode` is refused `AI_RUN_CONSUME_INVALID`. It sums the figure `usage` carries and never reads a price table (`agent-model` R13 prices a `null` figure on `apikey`; K2376).
  - A malformed entry is refused `AI_RUN_CONSUME_INVALID` (`run-rules` R3), counting nothing.
  - The counter holds no content, question or address, and is declared `export: "admin-only"`.
  - Rows from before T40 are kept with owner "not recorded" and count toward no limit.

**Limits** (`aiLimitSet`)
- **R2** (D39; B4; was `ai-runs` R50's setting half) `aiLimitSet({owner, scope, unit, period, amount, inclusive?, by})`.
  - `scope` is `overall`, a `USE_KINDS` entry, or (A4) `per_member` for a group or project account.
  - `unit` is `usd`, `tokens` or `calls`. `usd` on a member's sign-in is refused `LIMIT_UNIT_UNAVAILABLE`.
  - `period` is `day` or `month`.
  - `amount` is a positive number (`usd` to the cent; the others whole), or `null` to remove the limit.
  - `inclusive` (default `true`) is allowed only for a use scope.
  - Anything else is refused `AI_LIMIT_INVALID`, naming the field.
  - Who may set it is the owner's own act: the member (`NOT_YOUR_CEILING`); a project owner (`ai-accounts`' R10 refusals); an active administrator (`NOT_AN_ADMIN`).
  - At most one limit is held per owner, scope, unit and period. Each set is appended with who and when.
  - The migration writes today's ceilings as B4 says: a member's own daily ceiling becomes that member's account's `overall` day limits in tokens and calls; the copy-wide ceiling becomes the group account's `per_member` day limits. (T42; N848; K2592) Once carried, `ai_ceilings` is dropped in the same migration, as R1's pre-T40 counter table is, so a migrated store holds no table a fresh one lacks. A store whose carry already ran but which still holds the table drops it at its next migration. Idempotent.

**Judging** (`useCheck`)
- **R3** (D38 C, D39; B3, B5; was `ai-runs` R50's judging half) `useCheck({owner, member, use, at})` answers `null` or `AI_LIMIT_REACHED` with `{whose, scope, unit, period}` and its plain-words row, naming no cost.
  - It refuses when, for the current period, any of these has reached its amount:
    - the owner's `use` limit;
    - its `overall` limit, counted over the uses that are not exclusive, unless `use`'s limit is exclusive;
    - its `per_member` limit, counted over `member`'s use of that account.
  - It judges only the paying account's limits (D38: never another account's money limits).
  - For `explore` it refuses `EXPLORE_NOT_ENABLED` when the owner's `explore` setting is `no` (A5, B6; K2400). With `yes` and no `explore` limit held, `explore` is judged against the `overall` limit alone; `ask` without that day's approval is R6's answer, not this one's. (T42; N831) The owner's `explore` value is read through `ai-accounts.accountUsesOf` (its R17), with no viewer. It reads as `no` when the account is not held, cannot be read, or holds a value other than `no`, `ask` or `yes` (fail closed). It is never read through `accountUses` asked as one of the account's owners.
  - It writes nothing and never throws. A counter that cannot be read answers the refusal (fail closed).
  - (T43; N856; DEC-189 (5)) When the limit cannot be judged (the counter cannot be read, or the use is not a `USE_KINDS` entry), the refusal is still `AI_LIMIT_REACHED`, but it carries `unjudged: true` and no `scope`, `unit` or `period`, because nothing was reached.

**Reads** (`aiUsage`, `aiUsageMine`, `limitsReached`)
- **R4** (was `ai-runs` R51; B8) `aiUsage({owner, viewer, month})` answers that account's owners the month's use per `use`, summed over members and naming none. Anyone else is refused as R2 refuses. `aiUsageMine({viewer, day?, month?})` answers a member their own use per payer and per use, against each limit that bound them, (T41, D12; amended) a cost per answer only to the paying account's owners (R10, R11); nobody sees another member's spending. Neither writes.
- **R5** (B7) `limitsReached({viewer, at})` answers, for each account the viewer owns, each limit first reached in its current period: `{owner, scope, unit, period, period_start, reached_at}`, with a stable key per owner, limit and period. It is for `notice-producers` R16, writes nothing and never throws.

**Exploring** (`exploreAllowed`, `exploreAsk`, `exploreAsksPending`, `exploreApprove`)
- **R6** (A5, K2350; B6) `exploreAllowed({owner, question, at})` is for the explorer (B9). It answers `null`, `{ask: true}`, or a refusal:
  - `EXPLORE_NOT_ENABLED` when the owner's `explore` is `no`;
  - `{ask: true}` when it is `ask` and the owner has not approved exploring for that local day (R9);
  - R3's `AI_LIMIT_REACHED` (its `overall` limit and its `explore` limit, B5);
  - `ai-accounts.aiKeptAway({use: "explore"})`;
  - the question outside the owner's scope (B6; `connections.citesInto` for a project), refused `EXPLORE_OUT_OF_SCOPE` (C-143.5; the group's scope is every question the record holds, a project's those whose `citesInto(question).confirmed` holds it, a member's none until D36 is settled; K2480), or every project it is drawn on keeping its material from `explore` (`ai-accounts.projectsKeptAway`).
  - With `null` it also answers `label: {kind: "machine", enabled_by: owner}`, which the explorer attaches to what it offers.
- **R9** (A5, K2350; K2376 (2)) `exploreAsk({owner, at, what})` records, for an owner whose `explore` is `ask`, at most one pending ask a local day, stating what is worth exploring; `exploreAsksPending({viewer, at})` answers them to that account's owners, and `notice-producers` R16 makes each one "Ask" queue item (DEC-69, DEC-94's form; its words the design stream's; `queue` R1 gains the kinds, K2376); `exploreApprove({owner, day, by})`, by one of those owners, approves exploring for that day; silence means no. A second ask that day answers the first's key and mints nothing. Refusals as R2's for who may act. `exploreAsksPending` writes nothing and never throws. (T41, D12; amended) Each Ask item states the questions and R10's rough cost.

**Cost before and after** (`estimate`, `actualOf`; T41-22; D12)
- **R10** (D12) `estimate({owner, use, mode, count?, at, viewer})` (`viewer` as the code takes it, K2590) answers, before an AI act or exploring run (or a batch, `ai-runs` R74), a range `{low, high, unit}` ("enough" is 5 measured acts of that use and mode; the range the least and greatest per-act figure over the owner's latest 20, times `count`; unit `usd` only when every act in the sample stated a cost; BOB's count, K2480) from that account's measured runs of that use and mode, or `"not known yet"` until enough are measured (the count BOB's); money where the account reports cost, tokens and calls on a subscription; answered only to the account's owners.
- **R11** (D12) `actualOf({run | act, viewer})` answers the actual cost after, as R10's units, only to the paying account's owners; F11's "never shown" retires for those owners only.
- **R12** (DEC-188, owed: the panel's reads; K2448) `aiLimits({owner, viewer})` (`op=ailimits`, declared by `op-declarations` R41) answers each limit set on one account (R2's table: scope, use, unit, period, inclusive or on top), with its use in the current period (R5's sums, naming no member) and its history (set, changed, removed; who and when), to that account's owners only (`ai-accounts` R15's owners: the member, the project's owners, or administrators for the group's key); anyone else is refused as `ai-accounts` R15 refuses them, writing nothing.
- **R13** (DEC-188 (7); K2448) The member-facing sentence of each refusal is read by key from the design stream's `words.json`: `AI_LIMIT_REACHED` as `ai.refused.limit`, `ai.refused.limit.overall` or `ai.refused.limit.member` by its scope, `{whose}` filled from `ai.whose.group`, `ai.whose.project` or `ai.whose.own`, never a cost; `AI_LIMIT_INVALID` as `ai.refused.limitinvalid`; `LIMIT_UNIT_UNAVAILABLE` as `ai.refused.unitunavailable`; `EXPLORE_NOT_ENABLED` as `ai.refused.explorenotenabled`; R9's Ask item as `ai.queue.exploreask`. A key the words file lacks fails its test, never a fallback sentence. (T43; N856; DEC-189 (1), (5); B123 (1)) Every placeholder is filled by key, and this module writes no fill of its own: `{period}` from `ai.period.day|month`; `{when}` from `ai.when.day`, or from `ai.when.month` with `{month}` (the next period's month) from `date.month.<month>`; `{use}` inside a sentence from `ai.use.<use>.inline`, and `{Use}` at a sentence's start from `ai.use.<use>.name`; `{field}` from `ai.limitfield.<field>`; R3's unjudged refusal from `ai.refused.limit.unjudged`, with `{whose}` only. Each entry of `AI_USE_WORDS` equals its `words.json` `en` verbatim, `ai.refused.explorenotenabled` included ("Exploring is off on {whose} account. Its owners can switch it on."). A test fails on any difference. (T43; N862; DEC-190 (3)) `{use}` for `transcribe` reads `ai.use.transcribe.name` and `ai.use.transcribe.inline`. (T44; N859, N869, N876; DEC-191 (1), (2), DEC-192 (4)) `EXPLORE_OUT_OF_SCOPE` is read as `ai.refused.exploreoutofscope`, `{whose}` filled from `ai.whose.*`, and `EXPLORE_ASK_INVALID` as `ai.refused.exploreaskinvalid`; neither row keeps a sentence of its own. `{use}` and `{Use}` read `ai.use.<use>.inline` and `ai.use.<use>.name` for all nine uses (`enquire`, `read` and `account` among them). `ai.use.suggestions` names a switch, not a use, and is not read here. The refusals' `{when}` keeps `ai.when.*` (`ai.when.month` now "on 1 {month}", read verbatim; `ai.until.*` is the queue item's, `notice-producers` R16). `AI_USE_WORDS` equals `words.json` for every key it reads.

**Use over time** (T48-29; N1026; DEC-215 (1); K3138, K3198)
- **R14** (T48; N1026; DEC-215 (1); K3138, K1450, K3198) `accountUseOverTime({owner, viewer, at})` (`op=aiuseovertime`) answers one account's use over time to that account's owners, with R12's owners and refusals, `owner` spelled as the Terms spell it. It answers `{owner, days, periods}`:
- **R15** (T50; N1168; K3501 (f); `agent-model` R21; `ai-runs` R72, R88; amends R1, R11) **Each conversation's effort is recorded beside its model.** `countUsage` and `countAskUsage` take the conversation's `effort` with its `model`: a lowercase word of at most 16 letters, or null where none was stated; any other value is refused `AI_RUN_CONSUME_INVALID`, counting nothing. With an act (R10) both are kept in the act's measure: for each act the models and efforts its conversations ran at, with the calls of each. `actualOf` (R11) answers them to the owners it answers the cost to, as `by_model: [{model, effort, calls}]` in first-seen order, `model` and `effort` null where not stated (never a guessed one), their calls summing to `calls`. The counter `ai_usage` (R1) keeps no model or effort key. Test: two conversations (`claude-sonnet-5-5`/`low` twice, `claude-opus-5-5`/`medium` once) under one act answer two `by_model` entries with 2 and 1 calls; a non-owner is answered as R11 answers. Control: an entry with `effort: "Low!"` is refused and counts nothing; an entry stating neither model nor effort is kept as `{model: null, effort: null}`.
  - `days`: the thirty local days (`civil-time`) ending with the day of `at`, oldest first, each `{day, calls, dollars}`, read from R1's counter (`dollars` the summed `estimated_cost_usd`); a day with no use is answered with zeros.
  - `periods`: one entry for each limit set on the account (R2), `{scope, unit, period, period_start, used, limit}`, `used` the use counted against that limit in its current period, over the period's local days up to and including the day of `at` (R3's sums; a `per_member` limit's `used` is the most any one member used, naming none, as R12 answers it), `limit` in the limit's unit; with no limit set, one entry `{scope: "overall", unit: "usd", period: "month", period_start, used, limit: null}`, `used` the month's summed estimated dollars.
  - Every other figure is summed over every member the account serves and names no member (K1450). The days of a month sum to that month's total as R4's `aiUsage` answers it.
  - When the use cannot be read it answers `unreadable: true`, never zeros. It writes nothing and never throws.
  - Tests: two members' uses on three days answered as day totals naming neither; a day with none answered zeros; a day limit and a month limit each answered with `used`; the month's days summing to `aiUsage`'s month; a non-owner refused as R12 refuses; control: the counter made unreadable answers `unreadable: true`, not zeros.
- **R17** *(not yet met: T51)* (T51 fix round 10; STORE-REQUEST #5 J14, B9 (3); K5192; K5132's rule, `credentials`' `#nowMs` its pattern) Every instant this module records, and every judgement of one, reads the store's clock: a handed `now` first, else the store's `env.BIO_NOW_MS`, else the wall clock; a duration measured for a reply stays on the wall clock. So a world pinned to a clock (`store-request` R-CLOCK) sees this module's instants on that clock.

## Private

### Uses

- `record-grammar`: the shared grammar names and the refusal shape (R8).
- `civil-time`: `localDay` and the local month (R1–R5, R9).
- `record-core`: `declareTable`, `transact` (R1, R7).
- `membership`: the administrator test and `notAnAdmin` (its R64, R84), `isProjectOwner` (its R54) (R2, R4, R5, R9).
- `ai-accounts` (T48; N996, split map §5; was `credentials`, which this module no longer uses): `USE_KINDS` (its R14), the project account's owner refusals (its R10), `aiKeptAway` and `projectsKeptAway` (its R7, R22), the owner's `explore` value through `accountUsesOf` (its R17; R3, R6, R9), and `accountUses`'s owners and refusals (its R15; R12, R14).
- `connections`: `citesInto` (R6's project scope).
- `run-rules`: `AI_RUN_CONSUME_INVALID`'s row (its R3, R11) and the retired ceiling codes' successors (its R20).

### Invariants

- **R7** The tables (`ai_usage`, `ai_limits` and their history) are declared through `record-core.declareTable`: `export: "admin-only"`, `sight: "group"`, purged only with the whole store. A project's limits are deleted with its project.
- **R8** Each code it mints is an invariant with its test (K6), its rows in its own `checks.mjs`: `AI_LIMIT_REACHED` (carrying `whose`, `group`, `project` or `own`, `scope` and `period`; it replaces `AI_USE_CEILING_REACHED` and `AI_USE_COPY_CEILING_REACHED`, retired in `run-rules` R20), `AI_LIMIT_INVALID`, `LIMIT_UNIT_UNAVAILABLE` and `EXPLORE_NOT_ENABLED` (B11; K231), each taking the next free number of this module's family at the job's START and awaiting promotion's stamp (T41). (T44; N859, N869; K2650; DEC-191 (1)) Its codes also include `EXPLORE_OUT_OF_SCOPE` (C-143.5, R6) and `EXPLORE_ASK_INVALID` (C-143.6, R9), each with its row in `checks.mjs` and a test; `EXPLORE_OUT_OF_SCOPE` carries `whose` (`group`, `project` or `own`), as `AI_LIMIT_REACHED` does.

### Satisfies

- `docs/architecture/BIO_Assistant_and_AI_Roles_v0_1.md` §6 (the account cascade, as folded at T40's opening, K2373).
- `docs/architecture/BIO_Capability_Ladders_v0_1.md` §2 "Cross-cutting rulings" and §10 (exploring, K1481 revised for exploring only, K2373).
- DEC-215 (1) (the usage bars and meter on an account's panel; R14; N1026, K3138).
- INVESTIGATION-DESIGN D34, D37, D38, D39 as Bob answered them (K2350, K2352, K2353); K1450 (no cost per answer; retired for the paying account's owners by D12, R4, R10, R11, T41), K1755 (every use the member's act).

### Suggestions

- **Build by copy (K624, K2275 (3)).** Copy `ai-runs/index.mjs`:2591–2940 (the counter, the ceilings and the reads) here first; `ai-runs` (T40-8) deletes its copy and re-points after this module merges.
- **The explorer is not built here** (B9; N815): R6 and R9 are its gate and its daily ask, built and tested without it.
- **Tests.** Each refusal gets a negative control; R3's inclusive and exclusive arms (an exclusive use refused only at its own limit, and the overall limit judged without it); R1's `null` `calls` counted as one; `explore` refused `EXPLORE_NOT_ENABLED` at `no`, and at `yes` with no `explore` limit judged on `overall` alone (control: under the overall limit it passes); a pre-T40 row counted toward no limit; R9's second ask on a day minting nothing.

- **T47 (T47-70).** R13 already requires `AI_USE_WORDS` to equal `words.json` for every key it reads, and its quoted sentence (`ai.refused.explorenotenabled`) is unchanged on `main`, so its text stands. The five reds (K3022) are one stale entry: DEC-198/DEC-199 re-worded `ai.refused.limit.unjudged` ("… your group's Civicsmith couldn't check the use of {whose} account …"); the job brings `AI_USE_WORDS` to the file, and the tests pass unchanged.

## Open for Bob

None: Bob's answers are A1–A5 (K2350, K2352, K2353); the rest is BOB's (K2373, K2376).

- **R16** *(not yet met: T51)* (T51; K4168; the T51 declaration pass; op-declarations R80, R81; op-grades R49, R50; test-support R15) **The module declares the ops it serves that the screens send.** `DECLARED_OPS` is exported beside the ops map: a frozen object keyed by the op's door name, each row `{classes, machineClasses?, mutating, weight, description, fields: {accepts, requires}}`, its class, weight and description copied from the op's existing rows and its fields read from the arm whole (the stamps and the shell's `reason` are not accepts unless the arm reads a `reason` of its own): `ailimitset`, `exploreapprove`. Test: `declaredOpHolds` for each, with only its requires, without each, and with a field outside its accepts (`declared-ops.test.mjs`).
