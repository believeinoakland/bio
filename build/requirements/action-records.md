# action-records — requirements

**Status** · Drafted 2026-10-12 on `tranche/T47` (the opening's act, plan rule 3; K3027). Split from `actions` by copy (K617, K624, K531, K2982; N961; T47-37), for size (4,005 lines after T46-32), meaning unchanged. Each id names its `actions` source, which retires the moved ids as "moved to action-records R<n>" (T47-38). The extraction map is `build/extraction/actions-split.md`, its §4 table adopted (K2982; its line numbers re-taken on `tranche/T47` after T46-32's merge). Every requirement is not yet met (T47). Last changed T48 (T48-47: R16 new, amending R4, the one site minting C-32.4 and C-33.6–C-33.9, which `actions`' `actionCorrespond` calls; N1024; K231, K3125, K3189, K3195); marked not yet met (T48).

### Purpose

What the group records about an action in records of their own, apart from the action's document (State Rules v1.5 §4.4; Action v0.2 rules 6, 15): the proposals a credential makes of an action's governing laws, risk tier and what a records request seeks, stored apart from the member's value and never it (DEC-24: a machine proposes, a member acts); and the members' side records of an action: that a sent entry was received or served, the action's confidential scope, and the promises the group made to people. `actions` reads each into the action's block (its R25) and asks this module's four single-site judgments (R7–R10) at its own acts, so each code keeps one site. This module writes no action document and calls nothing of `actions`'.

### Provides

Terms are `actions`'. An **action** is a bundle whose type normalises to `action`; a **proposal** is a row stored apart, labelled, and never the action's value. `viewer`, `author` and `proposer` are the control plane's stamps. Every refusal names `reason`; a catalogue-backed one carries its `code`, `check` and `translation` (its row `action-grammar`'s, its R9).

#### Proposals stored apart: actionLawsPropose({target, laws, proposer, viewer}) (`op=actionlawspropose`), actionRiskPropose({target, tier, basis, proposer, viewer}) (`op=actionriskpropose`), actionSeeksPropose({target, seeks, proposer, viewer}) (`op=actionseekspropose`)

- **R1** (was `actions` R19; REC-195) `actionLawsPropose`: `NO_AUTHOR` (no stamped proposer); `NO_TARGET`; R7's list refusals; `NO_SUCH_BUNDLE`; `NOT_AN_ACTION`. Any credential may propose, and each `{level, citation, standard?}` entry may name a held standard, asked through R9. It replaces that proposer's standing proposal on the action and nobody else's, writes no file and never changes the list, and answers the proposal with its label (`action-grammar`'s `lawProposalLabel`: `machine_proposed`, `member_proposed` or `unstated`, with its sentence), the list as it stands (`actions` R25), `evidence: false`, and a sentence saying it is not the list. `lawProposalsFor(id)` answers the standing proposals, newest first, at most `LAW_PROPOSALS_READ_MAX` (12) proposers, with `truncated` and a sentence also when empty; `actions` R25 shows them beside the member's list.
- **R2** (was `actions` R28) `actionRiskPropose`: `NO_AUTHOR`; `NO_TARGET`; `BAD_RISK_TIER` (R8); `RISK_PROPOSAL_BASIS_REFUSED` (empty, over `RISK_PROPOSAL_BASIS_MAX` (500), or a quote, backslash or line break); `NO_SUCH_BUNDLE`; `NOT_AN_ACTION`. Any credential may propose; a proposer's restatement replaces its own proposal only. It writes no file and never touches `risk_tier` or its history; it answers the proposal labelled (machine work or a member's), the tier as held, `evidence: false`, and a sentence saying it is not the tier. `riskProposalsFor(id)` answers at most `RISK_PROPOSALS_READ_MAX` (12) standing proposals, newest first, with `truncated` and a sentence also when empty; `actions` R25 shows them.
- **R3** (was `actions` R73; T41; K2561) `actionSeeksPropose`, as R1 is to `actions.actionLaws`: `NO_AUTHOR` (no stamped proposer); `NO_TARGET`; `NO_SUCH_BUNDLE`; `NOT_AN_ACTION`; `action-grammar` R13's findings over the proposed `seeks` on the target (its wrong-kind finding for a target not a `records_request`), through R10 (`SEEKS_REFUSED`, C-117.29, every finding carried). Any credential may propose; a proposer's restatement replaces its own standing proposal on the action only. It writes no file and never changes `seeks`, and answers the proposal labelled (`machine_proposed`, `member_proposed` or `unstated`, with its sentence), `seeks` as it stands, `evidence: false`, and a sentence saying it is not the action's `seeks`. `seeksProposalsFor(id)` answers at most `SEEKS_PROPOSALS_READ_MAX` (12) standing proposals, newest first, with `truncated` and a sentence; `actions` R25 lists them beside `seeks`.

#### Members' side records: actionReceipt(...) (`op=actionreceipt`), actionScope(...) (`op=actionscope`), actionPromise(...) (`op=actionpromise`)

- **R4** (was `actions` R80; T45; S1 §C 9; v0.2 rule 6; reconciliation R7, R15) `actionReceipt({target, ord, kind, at, how, party?, artifactSha? | account?, author, viewer})`: a member records that the `sent` entry at `ord` was received (`kind: "receipt"`) or served (`kind: "service"`, `party` naming the party served, 1 to `RECEIPT_TEXT_MAX` (200) characters): `at` a real date or local date-time (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`), `how` 1 to 200 characters, held as a capture the register holds or a member's account (`actions` R34's rule). Refusals in order: `MACHINE_CANNOT_CORRESPOND`; `NO_TARGET`; `BAD_DATE`; `CAPTURE_AND_TESTIMONY`; `NEITHER_CAPTURE_NOR_TESTIMONY`; `NO_SUCH_BUNDLE`; `NOT_AN_ACTION`; `RECEIPT_NOT_ON_SENT` (the entry is not `sent`, or `kind` is neither of `RECEIPT_KINDS`); `UNREGISTERED_ARTIFACT`. A second record appends. `receiptsOf(id)` answers them as `[{ord, kind, at, how, party?, …}]`, oldest first, so the latest is last (K2845); `actions.actionRead` answers them as `receipts`. It is its own table, never rewriting the entry; `action-clocks` R2 reads it, through `actions.actionRead`, as the start where a rule counts from receipt or service. Control: a receipt on a `received` entry is refused.
- **R5** (was `actions` R87; T45; Actions D4; v0.2 rule 15) `actionScope({target, confidential, reason, author, viewer})`: a member who may see the action sets (`true`) or removes (`false`) its confidential scope, with a reason (`actions` R14's text rule). Refusals in order: `MACHINE_CANNOT_SET_SCOPE`; `NO_TARGET`; `SCOPE_NO_REASON`; `BAD_REASON`; `NO_SUCH_BUNDLE`; `NOT_AN_ACTION`; `SCOPE_UNCHANGED`. Each statement is appended (`by`, `at`, `reason`). `scopeOf(id)` answers the statements, and `confidential(id)` whether the latest one is confidential (false with none, K2850), which `actions.actionRead` and `actionsFor` answer as `confidential: true|false` and `actions` R66 reads. A confidential action is seen inside the group as before and never answered by `actions` R66 or any registration feeding published output; a change alters what R66 answers from then on and never a signed edition (`publication` R63), the answer saying so with `actions.scope.published_stays` (R14). Control: the same action with the scope removed is answered by `actions` R66 again.
- **R6** (was `actions` R88; T45; Actions D4; v0.2 rule 15) `actionPromise({target, kind, text, ends?, author, viewer})`: a member records a promise the group made to a person, `kind` of `PROMISE_KINDS` (`action-grammar` R2), `text` 1 to `PROMISE_TEXT_MAX` (500) characters, `ends` the position of an earlier promise this one ends (`text` its reason). Refusals in order: `MACHINE_CANNOT_RECORD_PROMISE`; `NO_TARGET`; `PROMISE_REFUSED` (kind, text, or an `ends` naming no standing promise); `NO_SUCH_BUNDLE`; `NOT_AN_ACTION`. Appended, never edited. `promisesOf(id)` answers every promise, standing apart from ended, and `actions.actionRead` answers them to every viewer who may see the action; nothing published carries one (`actions` R66).

#### The single-site judgments `actions` asks: lawEntries(laws), badRiskTier(target, tier, who), standardSeen(id, viewer), seeksRefusal(fm)

- **R7** (was `actions` R18, its list-shape clause; D-149) `lawEntries(laws)` judges a governing-laws list's shape and never the law, answering the parsed `{level, citation, standard?}` entries or the first refusal, in order: `NO_LAWS` (C-73.2, not a non-empty list; a string is parsed as JSON first); `TOO_MANY_LAWS` (C-73.5, over `GOVERNING_LAWS_MAX` (12)); `BAD_LAW_LEVEL` (C-73.3, with the index and the legal levels `LAW_LEVELS` holds); `BAD_CITATION` (C-73.4: empty, over `CITATION_MAX` (200) characters, a quote, backslash or line break, or an entry repeated at its level, case-folded). It writes nothing. It is the one site of C-73.2–C-73.5: R1 asks it, and `actions.actionLaws` (its R18) asks it.
- **R8** (was `actions` R23, its `BAD_RISK_TIER` site) `badRiskTier(target, tier, who)` answers C-90.2 `BAD_RISK_TIER`, naming `target`, `tier` and `legal: [1, 2, 3]`, its detail saying `who` states a tier of 1, 2 or 3 and that undetermined is not a tier to set. It is the one site of C-90.2: R2 asks it, and `actions.actionRiskTier` (its R23) asks it.
- **R9** (was `actions` R64, its "a standard the viewer may see" clause; K1446) `standardSeen(id, viewer)` answers null when `id` is a `STD-` id the viewer may read (`standards.standardRead`), else `standards.noSuchStandard`'s one answer (`NO_SUCH_STANDARD`), absent and invisible alike; a read that throws is not seen. It writes nothing. R1 asks it, and `actions` asks it for a law's or a records law's `standard` (its R64).
- **R10** (was `actions` R70, its judgment; T41; H30 (1); K2505) `seeksRefusal(fm)` judges `fm.seeks` with `action-grammar.seeksFindings` (its R13), each distinct progression an item names read once through `progressions.readProgression` (its declared stage keys; a progression not held, or one that cannot be read, is read as not held, fail closed, and the refusal then carries `cause: "PROGRESSIONS_UNREADABLE"`), and answers null or the grammar's own refusal (C-117.29 `SEEKS_REFUSED`) with every finding. It writes nothing. R3 asks it, and `actions`' write fence (its R70) asks it.

#### The correspondence entry's one site (T48-47; N1024; K231, K3125)

- **R16** (T48; N1024; K231, K3125; amends R4; `actions` R101; `action-grammar` R29) This module holds the one site of five codes, each minted nowhere else in `actions` or here, and each refusal carrying its row (`withRow`, `action-grammar`'s R9): *(not yet met: T48)*
  - `correspondFence(author, extra?)` answers null for a member's stamp, and C-32.4 `MACHINE_CANNOT_CORRESPOND` for an empty or machine one (`isMachineIdentity`). Pure.
  - `correspondEntryRefusal({at, artifactSha, account, dateTime?}, extra?)` answers, first found, C-33.6 `BAD_DATE` (`at` not a real calendar date, `YYYY-MM-DD`; with `dateTime: true`, also accepted as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` on a real date), C-33.7 `CAPTURE_AND_TESTIMONY` (both a capture hash and an account), C-33.8 `NEITHER_CAPTURE_NOR_TESTIMONY` (neither), else null. Pure.
  - `unregisteredArtifact(sha, extra?)` answers null when the register holds `sha` (the `register` read contract, as R4 reads it), and C-33.9 `UNREGISTERED_ARTIFACT` naming `artifact_sha` otherwise. It writes nothing.
  - `extra` adds the caller's own fields (`target`, `at`, and its own `detail`, the sentence for its act) and never replaces `reason`, `code`, `check` or `translation`.
  - R4's `actionReceipt` answers these five conditions through them (`dateTime: true`), in R4's order, its answers unchanged field for field; `actions.actionCorrespond` calls them (its R101).
  - Each function's region in `src/action-records/index.mjs` is its row's `where` (`action-grammar` R29).
  - Controls: a machine author answers C-32.4 through `correspondFence`; `2026-02-30` answers `BAD_DATE`, and `2026-02-28T09:30` does so only without `dateTime`; both a hash and an account answer `CAPTURE_AND_TESTIMONY`; an unregistered hash answers `UNREGISTERED_ARTIFACT`; a well-formed entry answers null from each.

#### Its ops map; its instance

- **R15** (new; K61; the map's §1; `case-account` R12's form) `actionRecordsOf(host, deps)` answers the one instance for a host: every caller for the same host gets the same instance, its `deps` (`record`, `membership`, `progressions`, `standards`, `now`) reached lazily on the host unless given. At its creation it creates its six tables with the DDL `actions` created them by (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `action_law_proposals`' `standard` column added where absent), so a running store's rows are kept with no data move, and declares them (R11); a refused declaration is thrown at creation and no instance is kept. `actions`' factory creates it at its own creation, so its tables exist and are declared at every boot. `actionRecordsOps(r, url, body)` publishes this module's ops map, one route arm per act, reading each argument as `actions`' map read it (the target from the query, else the body; the stamps from the query): `actionlawspropose` (R1), `actionriskpropose` (R2), `actionseekspropose` (R3), `actionreceipt` (R4), `actionscope` (R5), `actionpromise` (R6), each answering exactly what its act answers, a catalogue-backed refusal with its row (`withRow`). The op names, their declarations, grades, help and `proposer` stamps are unchanged; the plane spreads the map (`plane`'s L11 job).

## Private

### Uses

- `record-grammar`: `parseFrontmatter`, `normalizeType`, `isMachineIdentity`, `BUNDLE_ID_RE`.
- `record-core`: `stampInstant`, `transact`, `readFile`, `declarePurge` (R11); the `bundles` and `files` read contract (its R37; an action's document).
- `membership`: `viewerPredicate` (every act's visibility).
- `action-grammar`: `lawProposalLabel`, `LAW_LEVELS`, `GOVERNING_LAWS_MAX`, `CITATION_MAX` (R1, R7), `RISK_TIERS`, `riskTierState` (R2, R8), `seeksFindings`, `seeksOf`, `SEEKS_MAX` (R3, R10), `PROMISE_KINDS` (R6), `governingLawsOf` (R1's answer), and its row families (R12; every refusal's row, its R9).
- `progressions`: `readProgression` (R10).
- `standards`: `standardRead`, `noSuchStandard` (R9).
- `civil-time`: `isCalendarDate` (R4).
- `provenance`: the `register` read contract (its R48; R4's `UNREGISTERED_ARTIFACT`), read as `actions` reads it.
- `test-support`: the tests' fixtures.
- Its users: `actions` creates it and calls R1–R10's reads and judgments (its R18, R23, R25, R64, R66, R70), and (T48) R16's site (its R101); `action-grammar`'s rows name its regions (their `where`s, T47-36); `plane` spreads R15's map; `affordances`, `escalation` and `action-clocks` tests drive its acts (the map's §5).

### Invariants

- **R11** (was `actions` R36, its six tables; K4, K23) `action_law_proposals`, `action_risk_proposals`, `action_seeks_proposals`, `action_receipts`, `action_scopes` and `action_promises` (`ACTION_RECORDS_TABLES`) are this module's, keyed by `bundle_id` and declared to `record-core`'s purge (`declarePurge("action-records", …)`). Every read answers an invisible action as an absent one.
- **R12** (a copy of `actions` R33, its share; DEC-24, DEC-49) A machine credential never records a receipt, sets a scope or records a promise; it may propose laws, a tier and what a request seeks, each stored apart and labelled, never the action's value.
- **R13** (a copy of `actions` R39) No place is named in this module's behaviour or outward text; its tests include the test profile (`build/layers.md`, rule 3).
- **R14** (a copy of `actions` R99, its R87 share; DEC-194; N913) The sentence R5 answers beside a changed scope is `actions.scope.published_stays`, answered with that key and the words `words.json` holds for it, read by key, never a copy. This module's refusal rows are `action-grammar`'s (its R9), their `where`s naming `src/action-records/index.mjs` (C-73.2–C-73.5, C-90.2, the receipt, scope, promise and risk-basis rows; `action-grammar`'s T47-36).

### Satisfies

- `BIO_State_Rules_Consistency_v1_5.md` §4.4 (the Action object); `BIO_Action_v0_1.md` §2's rulings (the governing laws D-149, REC-195; the risk tier D-182, REC-214): R1, R2, R7, R8.
- `BIO_Action_v0_2.md` (K2780; T45, N893) §4 rules 6 (receipt as a fact) and 15 (confidential scope; promises seen by every participant), §6 `confidential`; Actions D4; S1 §C 9: R4–R6.
- DEC-24 and DEC-49 (a machine proposes, a member acts; one code, one site): R1–R3, R7–R10, R12; R16 (K231; N1024). H30 (1), K2505, K2561 (what a request seeks): R3, R10.
- N961 (`actions`' split for size, K617; the map adopted, K2982): R11, R15.

### Suggestions

- **The copy (K624; the map's §2; line numbers on `tranche/T47`).** From `actions/index.mjs`: the constants (`LAW_/RISK_/SEEKS_PROPOSALS_READ_MAX` 86–89, `RISK_PROPOSAL_BASIS_MAX` 107, `RECEIPT_KINDS`, `RECEIPT_TEXT_MAX`, `PROMISE_TEXT_MAX`, `LOCAL_DT_RE` 111–119); `#standardSeen` (927), `#seeksRefusal` (969), `#lawEntries` (2191), `#badRiskTier` (2349), each made public with its body unchanged (N529's form); `actionLawsPropose` (2390–2464); `actionReceipt`, `#receiptsOf` (3224–3286); `actionScope`, `#confidential`, `#scopeOf` (3288–3332); `actionPromise`, `#promisesOf` (3334–3378); `actionRiskPropose`, `actionSeeksPropose` (3438–3498); `#seeksProposalsFor`, `#riskProposalsFor`, `#lawProposalsFor` (3500–3570); `PROPOSAL_SAYS`, `proposalLabelFor` (3574–3595); the six ops (3673–3680, 3710–3717); from `schema.mjs` the six tables (165–193, 205–262) and `migrate()`'s `standard` column. Copied (K57): `#visibleAction`, `#heldFm`, `#rows`, `#one`, `#nowMs`, `withRow`, and the one key `actions.scope.published_stays`. The prototype wrapper lists the six acts. No refusal code, text or bound changes; the DEC-49 REGION markers move with their code.
- **Who creates it (the map's §7 risk 1).** Nothing composes `action-records` until `actions`' job creates it in its factory and drops the six tables from `ACTIONS_TABLES` in the same commit; this module's tests build it alone, with a fixture that cannot build `actions` (later): an action is a bundle written directly through the record.
- **Tests** (`bio-plane/test/m/action-records/`, the map's §6): `acts.test.mjs`'s R19 and R28 arms (R1, R2), `t41.test.mjs`'s R73 arms (R3), `t45.test.mjs`'s R80, R87, R88 arms (R4–R6); R7–R10 each by name with a negative control; R11 the tables declared once; R15 the same instance per host. The read arms (`actionRead` showing proposals, receipts, scope and promises), R66's confidential control and R18, R23, R70's refusals through `actions`' own acts stay with `actions`, re-tagged.
- **`provenance` (R4).** `modules.json`'s row for this module (the opening's act) names no `provenance` edge, though R4 reads the register as `actions` does; the job adds it at its START if the use check asks a read contract's edge.
