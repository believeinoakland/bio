# events — requirements

**Status** · In force: a new product module, reviewed (K1505; T33-26); its meaning the canon ladders' and Bob's rulings (K1443, K1444, K1462, K1464, K1465, K1467, K1468, K1470, K1487, K1489, K1494); later changes cite their own.

**Size (P6).** About 2,400–2,900 lines at this scope (constructs-2 §4.1; B §(c)). Under 4,000.

### Purpose

What happens in the world (a meeting held or cancelled, a vote, an adoption, a signing, an award, a payment, an order entered, a statement), apart from the dates documents state. A **dated fact** is a document's own stated date; an **event** is a happening records attest, with when (precision, zone), who took part in what role, what it concerned, its attestations and cited relations. Timelines and sequence are three-valued; sequence is never stored; no amount, absence or group act is held; no cause inferred. Members see the **timeline** (K1462).

### Provides

Terms.
- **date-time**: `civil-time`'s instant or band with `precision` (day, minute, second, or EDTF level-1 band) and `zone`, by default the **governing zone** (K1444 (iii), K1464, K5292): `jurisdictions.governingZone(<active profiles>, <record-core's `team_time_zone`>)` (`jurisdictions` R98; `local-facts` R22): the team's stated zone, else the profiles', else none. A day value is never midnight.
- **Dated-fact kinds** (closed): `meeting`, `adopted`, `effective`, `signed`, `entered`, `issued`, `published`, `received`, `hearing`, `period_covered`, `edited`.
- **Event kinds** (closed): `meeting`, `vote`, `adoption`, `enactment`, `signing`, `award`, `payment`, `transfer`, `filing`, `order`, `hearing`, `issuance`, `publication`, `statement`, `communication`, `appointment`, `departure`, `inspection`, `other`; (T35) `discretion`, `waiver`, `assessment` (R43–R45).
- **Provision key** (T35): `{standard, portion?}`, a `standards` id and a portion path, each non-blank, ≤ 200 characters; opaque, shape checked only, never looked up (`events` does not use `standards`, P4); `standards` and `duties` read it.
- **Question** (T35; DEC-164 (5)): a held bundle id whose `object_type` is `inquiry` (`record-core` R37).
- **Statuses** (closed, schema.org `EventStatusType`): `EventScheduled`, `EventCancelled`, `EventPostponed`, `EventRescheduled`, `EventMovedOnline`. A cancelled meeting is one event, `EventCancelled`, never a missing one.
- **Roles** (closed): `actor`, `organizer`, `mover`, `seconder`, `voted` (with the profile's vote value), `present`, `speaker`, `sender`, `recipient`, `copied`, `signatory`, `decider`, `author`, `implementer`, `party`, `subject` (K1465). No payer or payee.
- **Relation kinds** (closed): `authorises`, `answers`, `amends`, `reverses`, `stated_cause`, `within`; (T48) `precedes` (R51).
- **Attestation**: a dated fact, a capture extent with no date (attesting participants or concerns only), or a member's **testimony** (own account, E4).
- **Viewer**: the control plane's stamp via `membership.viewerPredicate`; absent, fail closed.
- Refusal: `{ok: false, reason, detail}`, plus `code`, `check`, `translation` when catalogued. `by`: the control plane's stamp, a member or `class:<cls>` (machine, DEC-52), never a caller's field.

**recordDatedFact({captureSha, extent, kind, value, method, by})**
- **R1** Refuses, in order: `NO_SHA`; `CAPTURE_NOT_HELD` (absent or unseen, alike); `NO_EXTENT`, `EXTENT_NOT_IN_CAPTURE`; `UNKNOWN_DATED_KIND` (naming the list); `BAD_DATE` (`civil-time.isCalendarDate`: 2026-02-31); `NO_METHOD`; `QUESTION_NOT_HELD` (optional `question` not held or unseen by the actor, alike; R48). Else holds `{dated_fact_id, capture_sha, extent, kind, value, method, grade, by, at}`; a repeat (capture, extent, kind, value) answers `already: true`, writing nothing. A found extent (`retrieval.findIn`'s `capture_sha`, `extent`) is cited like any other: same refusals and grade (R2). (T35; N698, DEC-164 (4), (5))
- **R2** `grade` is the extent's capture grade, never the caller's; a machine-read date (reader, OCR, office metadata) carries that method, never graded above its source.
- **R3** Dated facts arise only from a member's act or R4, never a sweep of all readings (K1468).
- **R4** Registers once on `reading-pipeline.onRead` for its opt-in capture classes; after commit, holds each date the reader states as a dated fact, the reader's method. The set starts empty and changes only by a member's recorded act; other captures get nothing.
- **R5** (EVENTS stage 3) On request, an office capture's reader-exposed author, created and modified values are held as `edited` or `issued` dated facts, the method naming the field: the file's own statement, never a finding.

**createEvent({kind, status?, where?, concerns?, attestations, participants?, by}), attest({eventId, attestation, by}), chooseGoverning({eventId, attestationId, by})**
- **R6** `createEvent` refuses, in order: `UNKNOWN_EVENT_KIND`, `UNKNOWN_STATUS`, `NO_ATTESTATION` (at least one), each attestation's (R7), each `concerns` end's `NO_SUCH_ENTITY` (`entities.noSuchEntity`) or `NO_SUCH_EVENT`, each participant's (R11); `discretion`, `waiver`, `assessment` get `USE_NEEDS_ITS_ACT` (after `UNKNOWN_EVENT_KIND`; only R43/R44 hold them, with facet). Else allocates `EVT-<year>-<tail>` (`record-core`'s opaque allocator, `ID_TABLE`), writing event, attestations, participants in one transaction; `status` defaults `EventScheduled`. (T35; K1965)
- **R7** A document attestation cites a held dated fact (`NO_SUCH_DATED_FACT`) or capture extent (R1's capture and extent refusals), never copying a date (R-3 H-1). Testimony carries the member's statement (`NO_STATEMENT` if blank), grade D.
- **R8** The first dated attestation governs until a member's `chooseGoverning` (`NO_SUCH_ATTESTATION`, `ATTESTATION_UNDATED`), each choice kept with who, when, why.
- **R9** `when` derives only from the governing attestation, held in `when_cache` `{start, end, precision, zone}`, rebuilt in the transaction of any attestation, choice, merge or split (R14). Undated: `when: null`, "placed nowhere", never a default.
- **R10** A read whose `when_cache` differs from its rebuild fails closed: `when: undetermined`, `why` `events.why.cache_stale` with fills (R54), never the stale value (`record-core`'s derived-cache convention).

**addParticipant({eventId, entityId, role, attestation, voteValue?, by}), correctParticipant({participantId, entityId, reason, by})**
- **R11** Refuses, in order: `NO_SUCH_EVENT`; `NO_ENTITY`/`NO_SUCH_ENTITY` (`entities.noEntity`, `noSuchEntity`); `UNKNOWN_ROLE` (naming the list; detail: payer/payee is on the money fact); `NO_ATTESTATION` (never from office holding, R-3 H-10); for `voted`, `NO_VOTE_VALUE` / `UNKNOWN_VOTE_VALUE` (naming the values). Values: the active profiles' `vote_values` (`jurisdictions` R58) on `value`; an imported value (R22) matching no `value` is matched exactly on `label` (Legistar's `Aye`, `Excused`), the `value` held (K1788); no own list. With no profile values, a `voted` value is kept as written, `vote_value_checked: false` with why, never checked against a default (T33). A repeat (event, entity, role, attestation) answers `already: true`.
- **R12** Each participant answers its entity's resolution grade in the attesting capture (`entities.resolutionsFor`, strongest) beside its attestation's grade, never combined.
- **R13** `correctParticipant` refuses `NO_REASON`, `NO_SUCH_PARTICIPANT`; the old row stays superseded (who, when, why), the new keeps role and attestation, R16 told `participant_re_resolved` in the transaction; nothing deleted.

**mergeEvents({keep, absorb, reason, by}), splitEvent({eventId, attestations, reason, by})**
- **R14** Member only (machine: `MEMBER_ACT_ONLY`); `NO_REASON`, absent event refused. Merge moves `absorb`'s attestations, participants, relations to `keep`, `absorb` an alias of `keep`; split moves the named attestations to a new event. Each is kept with who, when, why, rebuilds every touched `when_cache`, tells R15.

**onWhenChanged(module, fn), onEventChanged(module, fn)**
- **R15** `onWhenChanged`: a later module registers once (malformed or second: `membership.listenerRefusal`); listeners run in `MODULE_ORDER` inside the transaction changing a `when_cache`, given `{eventId, before, after}`, so event-bounded rows' `bound_cache` moves there (R-3 I-1); a throw fails the write.
- **R16** `onEventChanged` (same registration) runs after commit for `when_moved`, `participant_re_resolved`, with event id, change and `at` (this module's stamped instant of that write, one for all listeners), to order against dependants' writes (`reevaluation` R34's `since`).

**relate({from, to, kind, attestation, by}), withdrawRelation({relationId, reason, by})**
- **R17** `relate` refuses, in order: `UNKNOWN_RELATION`, `NO_ENDS`, `SELF_RELATION`, `NO_SUCH_EVENT` (naming the end), `NO_ATTESTATION`. Held with two grades: its attestation's and its ends' governing attestations'.
- **R18** `stated_cause` is only a named source's claim: capture-extent attested (testimony `CAUSE_NEEDS_SOURCE`), never machine (`CAUSE_NOT_MACHINE`), always read "<source> states", never asserted. A member's hypothesised cause is not held (K1467).
- **R19** `within` puts a sub-event in a larger one (a vote in a meeting); a loop is `WITHIN_CYCLE`.
- **R20** `withdrawRelation` refuses `NO_REASON`, `NO_SUCH_RELATION`; repeat `already: true`; the relation remains, shown withdrawn (who, when, why).

**aliasAct({actId, eventId, by}), eventForAct(actId)** (`ACT-` ids become aliases of events)
- **R21** `aliasAct` refuses `NO_ACT` (not `ACT-`), `NO_SUCH_EVENT`, then `ACT_ALIASED` (names another event). `eventForAct` answers the event or `found: false`, never throws.

**followedImport({captureSha, body, period, by})** (Legistar following, the machine's writes; K1443 as BOB extended it, K1468)
- **R22** Refuses `NO_BODY`, `NO_PERIOD` (the body and period a member follows; K1468), `CAPTURE_NOT_HELD`, then `NOT_LEGISTAR` (not a `legistar-reader` capture). Writes only rows with source ids at both ends: events by `EventId` (meeting), `EventItemId` (item votes, `within` the meeting); participants whose `PersonId` resolves by scheme identifier to a registered entity (`entities`, grade A), the rest answered in `unresolved` with their source row. Each meeting has one `concerns` end, `body` (read by R27). Rows are the machine's, cite their capture, correctable by R13, R14, R20.
- **R23** (K5292) A meeting starts at the source's day and separate local time joined by `civil-time.joinLocal` in the governing zone (Terms; no `EventDate` has a zone, M-V2), minute precision. A row stating cancellation (status or body name, M-V2 (2)) is the one event, `EventCancelled`.
- **R24** A posting time (`EventAgendaLastPublishedUTC`, `EventMinutesLastPublishedUTC`) is a `publication` of the agenda or minutes `within` its meeting, `when` only an upper bound, "on or before" the first instant the record saw that value (M-V2 (3)), never the first posting.
- **R25** Import is idempotent by source id: a held row changes in place only on a changed source value, recorded, R15/R16 told; a new row is added.

**readEvent({eventId, viewer}), datedFactsFor({captureSha, viewer}), eventsFor({entity, kinds?, from?, to?, limit, viewer})**
- **R26** `readEvent`: empty id `NO_EVENT`, absent `found: false`, alias its kept event. Answers kind, status, `when` (R9, R10), where, concerns, `within`, attestations with grades, participants (R12) with superseded marked, relations in and out, merges and splits.
- **R27** `eventsFor`: events the entity takes part in or that concern it, R31's order, with roles; `limit` clamped to 1–500 (default 100), `truncated` by one past. `datedFactsFor`: a capture's dated facts in extent order.

**timeline({set, from?, to?, lanes?, limit, viewer}), registerEventSource(module, fn)** (stage 2a)
- **R28** (T45; N893; Actions D4, D22; v0.2 rules 15, 17; R-reconciliation R9) Takes explicit entity or event ids (`NO_SET`, R53), never a project or inquiry (caller resolves, R-3 I-6). Answers the world's events concerning or involving them ("what they did") and, never interleaved, each source's items ("what we did"). `audience`: `"public"` or absent, else `AUDIENCE_UNKNOWN` (after `NO_SET`), nothing read; `"public"` leaves the world lane unchanged and each source lane is its source's answer (R30), nothing added, dropped or re-marked here.
- **R29** (K2810) Lanes follow R31; undetermined orders shown, bands with bounds. `from`/`to` bound placed items only, never one without `when`: listed apart as "placed nowhere" in the world lane, kept in a source lane marked `placed_nowhere: true` (read by `case-authoring`, `filings`). `limit` as R27, per lane.
- **R30** (T45; N893; Actions D4, D22; v0.2 rules 15, 17; R-reconciliation R9) Later modules (actions, docket, escalation) register once (`membership.listenerRefusal`); `fn({set, from, to, limit, viewer, audience})` answers own acts as `{at, label, ref, kind}`; `viewer`, `audience` passed as received, the same to all (`audience` `"public"` or key absent), so a fail-closed source answers what the reader may see. Public items (each `public: true`) are the source's (`actions` R66, `docket` R26, `escalation`'s). A lane is `truncated` if its source says so or `limit` cut it. A throwing source is answered `{source, error}` beside the lane, others kept.

- **R50** (T48-19; N1031; K3145; K3195; amends R28, R29; K5148; WALK-FINAL-07 R60; K5152) World-lane items also answer `participants` (as R26: entity, role, vote value, attestation, R12's two grades; superseded omitted, ≤ 50 in R26's order, with `participants_total`, `participants_truncated`) and `grade`: the governing attestation's (R8), or `null` with `grade_why` (none dates it) when placed nowhere. Only what the viewer may see is answered or counted (R40): a participant attested in a hidden capture is neither. Source lanes unchanged. `grade_why` and every event-view `why` is `{key, vars}` (e.g. `events.why.grade_placed_nowhere`, `events.why.grade_time_unread`, `events.why.placed_nowhere_attestation`, `events.why.dated_attestation_see`), never a `word`-made string.
- **R51** (T48-19; N1031; K3145; K3195; amends R17, R31, R35) **Order no date settles.** `relate` takes `precedes` (`from` before `to`) only for a pair R31 answers `undetermined` at the act, else `ORDER_ALREADY_DATED` naming R31's answer (after R17's); cited by a capture extent stating the order or a member's testimony graded D (R17), two grades, withdrawn by R20, machine `MEMBER_ACT_ONLY` (R41); an R35 link. While dates leave it undetermined, `sequence` answers from a standing visible `precedes` directly joining the pair: `before`/`after`, `basis: "cited"`, its id, two grades; relations both ways: `undetermined`, why disagreement (R54), both ids; no chains. Once dates order the pair they govern, the relation answered beside, `agrees: true`/`false`, never withdrawn by the module. Sequence stays computed (R41).
**sequence({a, b})** (stage 2a)
- **R52** (T48; K231; K3207; amends R34) R34's `NOT_A_PROCEEDING` is `entities.notAProceeding`'s answer (its R53).
- **R53** (T50-60; N1193; K3598; K3630; JOURNEYS V4 B-33; T51 fix round 2, C54, C6; K4310; amends R27–R30) `timeline` takes `captures` (sha256s, ≤ 200, else `TOO_MANY_CAPTURES` naming it, after `AUDIENCE_UNKNOWN`); `NO_SET` only when `set` and `captures` are both empty. (1) With `captures` and no `lanes`, or `lanes` naming it, `dated` `{items, placed_nowhere, limit, truncated}` is answered, its own list: dated facts as `datedFactsFor` gives them (`dated_fact_id`, `capture_sha`, `extent`, `kind`, `value`, `precision`, `zone`, `method`, `grade`, `by`, `at`, any `upper_bound`), ordered and bounded as R29 by stated date, unplaceable apart, `limit` as R27; no event made, no happening stated. A fact counts only for a viewer seeing its capture's bundle (R40); unheld and hidden captures add nothing, alike. Omitted under `audience: "public"`. (2) The world lane adds events attested (extent or dated fact) on one of `captures`, under R40, R30's audience, R27's limit, none repeated from `set`; e.g. an event with no `concerns`. The caller resolves a project to captures (R28).
- **R54** (T51; N1250, N1108; K3870; DEC-253; PEOPLE #8 J2; `civil-time` R30; `people` R40; `affordances` R63; amends R10, R31, R35, R51) **Keys, not words.** (1) Every `undetermined` `why` is `{key, vars}`, never English or a `word(...)` string: `events.why.cited_orders_disagree` (with `relation_ids`, `dates_why`), `events.why.precision_held_settle`, `events.why.placed_nowhere_event` (R31), the stale cache's (R10), and `civil-time.compare`'s (its R5) passed on unflattened. (2) R35's role and link words (`event_<role>`, `event_<link>`) hold no English: each reads DEC-253's `label.<set>.<value>` (`label.lineroles.*` for a line role), per `affordances` R63; a raw slug shown fails `journey-check` R6. Each such key's `word(key, vars)` is non-empty; every kind R35 registers has a word equal to `word` of its `label.<set>.<value>` key. Tests assert keys, never sentences.
- **R31** `before`, `after` or `undetermined` with why, from the `when`s by `civil-time.compare`: unsettled by band or coarser precision, or equal at precision, is `undetermined`, never guessed; no `when`: `undetermined`, `events.why.placed_nowhere_event` (R54). Computed per read, never stored.

**whoWasSent({eventId, viewer}), statementsOf({entity, from?, to?, limit, viewer})** (stage 3)
- **R32** `whoWasSent`: a `communication`, `issuance` or `meeting` event's `sender`, `recipient`, `copied`, `present` participants with attestations, worded "sent to", "copied", "present", never "knew" or "saw".
- **R33** `statementsOf`: `statement` and `communication` events where the entity is `speaker`, `sender`, `author` or `actor`, R31's order, undetermined shown, bounded as R27.

**proceedingStatusAt({proceeding, at, viewer})** (scope §1 COURTS; plan Choices 21)
- **R34** Refuses `NO_ENTITY`, `NO_SUCH_ENTITY`, then `NOT_A_PROCEEDING` (kind not `proceeding`). Answers the stage of the profile's flow for its kind (`jurisdictions`' `proceeding_flows`) its held events reach on `at`, with them, by `civil-time.validAt` and R31; `undetermined` with why if no flow is held, the deciding order is undetermined, or no event bears; never a default stage.

**neighbours({node, kinds, at, page})** (the connection owner; K1469, K1470)
- **R35** Registers once via `connection-grammar.registerOwner`, owner `events`, kinds: took part (per role), `concerns`, `within`, the five event links. `neighbours` answers an entity or event node's connections in its shape (evidence, both grade axes), valid at `at`, paged by its bounds, from indexes `event_participants (entity)`, `event_relations (from)`, `(to)`; passes `connection-grammar.ownerConformance`.

**The ops map**
- **R36** Publishes `eventsOps(events, url, body)`: route arms by op name, one per act and read, parameters (stamps among them) from `url`, arguments from the body; every write through one append site, control-plane stamped. Credentials per op are `op-declarations`' and `control-plane`'s.

**The read contract**
- **R37** `events` (`event_id`, `kind`, `status`), `event_when_cache` (`event_id`, `start`, `end`, `precision`, `zone`), `event_participants` (`event_id`, `entity_id`, `role`), `event_attestations` (`event_id`, `capture_sha`: each cited capture, K1563) are a read contract on `record-core` R37's terms: later modules may join them in SQL; writes stay here.

**A register row as an event**
- **R38** A court register row the court doctypes read, with a source entry id, becomes a `filing` or `order` event of the proceeding, written as R22, only for a followed proceeding.

**recordDiscretion({kind, provision?, statedReason, outcome, attestations, participants?, scope?, conditions?, expiry?, question?, by}), recordAssessment({provision, unmet, attestations, participants?, question?, by})** (T35; N642; POLICIES L3 PO6, PO7, STANDARDS L3 ST8; Capability Ladders §6B.4, §6B.5, §6C.4; K1713 (2), K1740; DEC-145 (7))
- **R43** (PO6, PO7) Holds one use of a power as a `discretion` or `waiver` (waiver, variance or exception granted) event, created and refused as R6, `decider` and `subject` participants (R11). More refusals, writing nothing, in order, the first two before R6's, the rest after (K1965): `KIND_NOT_DISCRETION` (other kind); `MEMBER_ACT_ONLY` (machine; it proposes, K1443); `PROVISION_MALFORMED` (given, not a key); `STATED_REASON_MISSING` (`statedReason` absent; it is an extent whose words state the reason, refused as R1's extent, or `"none"`, "no reason stated"); `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` (`outcome.value` not `granted`, `denied`, `partly_granted`, `other`; `outcome.extent`, its passage, refused as R1's extent); `QUESTION_NOT_HELD` as R1. A `waiver` needs `scope` (`WAIVER_NO_SCOPE`), an extent stating what is waived for whom; `conditions`, extents, empty "no conditions stated"; `expiry`, a `civil-time` date-time or null "no expiry stated" (`BAD_DATE` as R1); on `discretion` these are `FIELD_NOT_FOR_KIND`, named. Only a cited reason is held; absent `provision` is null, "provision not recorded".
- **R44** (ST8) Holds one accreditation or certification assessment as an `assessment` event, as R6, accreditor `decider`, assessed body `subject` (R11). `provision`: the standard assessed against (`PROVISION_MALFORMED`); `unmet`: possibly empty `{provision, extent}` list, a key found unmet (`PROVISION_MALFORMED`) and the capture extent stating it (R1's extent refusals; none: `UNMET_NOT_CITED`). `MEMBER_ACT_ONLY`, `QUESTION_NOT_HELD` as R43. Empty `unmet` reads "no standard found unmet", never "met"; nothing met is inferred.
- **R45** Reads answering an event (R26–R33, R35) give these its facet: `provision`, `stated_reason` (`{capture_sha, extent}` or `"none"`), `outcome`; a waiver's `scope`, `conditions`, `expiry`; an assessment's `provision`, `unmet`; and `says`: for `discretion` DEC-145 (7)'s "Discretion used by <decider>, <date>" plus "stated reason: …" (cited words) or "no reason stated", `<decider>` the decider's entity label, `<date>` `when` at precision, else "decider not recorded", "date not recorded"; for `waiver`, `assessment` the design stream's words, meanwhile plain sentences of this meaning, same form. Facets are never edited (R13, R14); `withdrawUse({eventId, reason, by})` refuses `NO_REASON`, `NO_SUCH_EVENT`, `KIND_NOT_DISCRETION` (not R43–R44's kinds), repeat `already: true`, leaving the event readable, shown withdrawn (who, when, why), out of R46.

**usesOf({provision?, decider?, subject?, kinds?, from?, to?, after?, limit, viewer})** (T35; the patterns' population, Capability Ladders §6B.5)
- **R46** Unwithdrawn `discretion`, `waiver`, `assessment` events (`kinds` narrows; other: `KIND_NOT_DISCRETION`), filtered by `provision` (no `portion`: every portion of that standard), `decider`, `subject` (entity ids), `from`/`to` on `when` (R29: placed-nowhere apart, never dropped). Items: R45's event with participants (R12), R31's order, `after` (event id) pages, `limit` clamped to 1–500 (default 100), `truncated` by one past, `count`, the number answered; the answer says these are the held uses this viewer may see, a population, not a census (§6B.5). Sight R40; writes nothing, never throws.

**The read contract, its T35 tables**
- **R47** (amends R37) `event_uses` (`event_id`, `kind`, `provision_standard`, `provision_portion`, `reason_stated` (1 extent, 0 `"none"`), `outcome`, `withdrawn`) and `event_unmet` (`event_id`, `provision_standard`, `provision_portion`) join R37's contract: `standards`, `duties`, `calculations` may join them, the key an opaque pair; writes stay here.

**The question kept beside a recorded row** (T35; N698, DEC-164 (5))
- **R48** A question given to R1, R43 or R44 stays beside its row, unchanged, answered with it by every read (`datedFactsFor`, `readEvent`, R46) to viewers who may see the inquiry's bundle (`membership.viewerPredicate`), absent (no field, no count) otherwise; none: `question: null`. R1 repeated with another question keeps the first, `already: true`.

**recordedBy({captureSha, extent?, limit?, viewer})** (T36; N715, DEC-164 (4): who recorded something from this passage)
- **R49** (T36-14; K1941, K2063, K2092; K2114, binding on every read in this shape; K231, K2116) The one shape naming who recorded each row citing a capture (also `standards` R49, `money` R24, `people` R36, every `retrieval` R76 read): `{ok: true, module, capture_sha, items, truncated}`, an item `{module, record, kind, field, extent, relation, by, at, withdrawn}` per row per cited extent: `record` row id; `kind` row kind; `field` citing field; `extent` `content.canonicalExtent`'s string parsed to an object (no part: `document`, `content` R5); `by` the stamp (member or `class:<cls>`, DEC-52); `at` this module's write instant; `withdrawn` true if withdrawn, superseded or corrected. With `extent`: rows where `content.extentRelation(extent, row's extent)` is `same`, `narrower`, `wider`, `relation` that; without: all, `relation` null. Order: canonical string (code units), `record`, `field`; `limit` clamped to 1–500 (default 100), `truncated` by one past. Sight R40, hidden rows uncounted; unheld or unseen capture: `items: []`. Refusals, writing nothing: `VIEWER_MISSING` (absent or empty viewer only; one membership refuses gets `items: []`), `NO_SHA`, `EXTENT_MALFORMED` (not an object of a `content` `CONTENT_EXTENT_KINDS` kind); `VIEWER_MISSING` and `EXTENT_MALFORMED` answer `{ok: false, refused, code, reason, why}`, no catalogue row in any module reading in this shape. Writes nothing, never throws; in-process, not an R36 arm. Rows: dated facts (`kind: "dated_fact"`, `field: "extent"`); extent attestations (`kind: "attestation"`, `record` the event id, alias as kept event, `by` the attesting act); a use's extents (R43, R44; `kind` the event's, `field` `stated_reason`, `outcome`, `scope`, `conditions` or `unmet`; `withdrawn` per R45). Testimony is never an item.

**One entry of a followed register is one event (T53; N1259)**

- **R58** (T53; N1259; C13 (5); T52-DEC406 §1 I8; `court-doctypes` R6, R18; `following` R41; K4571; amends R38, R25) **One register entry, one event.** `followedRegister({captureSha, proceeding, by})` takes `courtlistener_api` (CourtListener's keyed JSON entries, `court-doctypes` R18) beside `courtlistener_docket`, `cpuc_proceeding`, `ecourt_roa`; other types (an HTML page or JSON error body too) are `NOT_A_REGISTER`, writing nothing. (1) Identity: `(register system, proceeding, entry id)`, key `register:<system>:<proceeding>:<entry id>`, never the content type (`courtlistener_docket`, `courtlistener_api`: CourtListener). The entry id is the source's number, equal in a docket's HTML and JSON; with none (all `cpuc_proceeding`, `ecourt_roa` rows, `court-doctypes` R6) a row is `skipped`, never matched by date or text; never across proceedings. (2) A reading of an entry with an event adds its capture as one more attestation (extent, and dated fact where the date reads), never repeated (R7's `sameAttestation`), listed in `readings_added: [{entry_id, event_id, content_type}]`, not `written`: no new event or `concerns` end, kind, status, `within` unchanged. A type already attesting with the same date and text adds nothing (`unchanged`). (3) The first reading's kind (`filing`/`order`, R38) stands; `when` comes only from the governing attestation (R8, R9). Another stated kind or date goes in `disagreements: [{entry_id, event_id, field, held, stated, content_type}]`, held with the attestation, shown wherever the event is (`readEvent`, beside the governing reading, both captures); it never fails or changes the tick, never overwrites, merges or chooses: a member settles it (R8, R14). (4) Each attestation keeps its capture's grade (`provenance.captureGrade`, R2, R7), never combined (R12); a `provisional` reading (`court-doctypes` R7, R18: JSON shape assumed until a member's authenticated capture) shows `provisional: true` in `readings_added`, `disagreements`, never graded above its capture. Rows are the machine's (`class:daemon`, R22), cite their capture, correctable by R13, R14, R20; the content type is `extraction`'s (no new column). (5) Lookup tries the new key, then for `courtlistener_docket` the old `register:<content type>:<proceeding>:<entry id>`, re-keying a found row in the transaction; no event rewritten, merged or duplicated. HTML or JSON first, the outcome is the same. A hidden capture (R40) adds no attestation for a viewer who may not see it.

- **R59** (T53; N1259; C13 (5); amends R41, R25) **A second reading is no change and mints no event** (R41): not R25's update, nothing told to R16 unless it moves the `when_cache` (it cannot, R58 (3)). A changed date or text in the same form is R25's update. R41's absence rule stands: a row a later reading no longer states is not an event that ended; no event is deleted.

**The timeline over captures, and withdrawing an event (T53; JOURNEYS W7)**

- **R60** (T53; JOURNEYS R-84, D2 events R?1; K5786; amends R28) **Many captures answer.** `timeline` given a standard page's `captures` (its walked fixture; 200) answers `ok: true` with their events and dated facts within the act's time class, never a server error, gateway timeout or 502 (cause the job's to find; PLATFORM told the limit). An unknown capture adds nothing, as a hidden one (no refusal names which exist). `set` alone unchanged.
- **R61** (T53; JOURNEYS R-83 owner half, D2 events R?2; K5476; in R20's form) **`withdrawEvent({eventId, reason, by})`.** Refuses in order, writing nothing: `NO_REASON` (blank or absent), `NO_SUCH_EVENT` (absent or unseen, alike); repeat `already: true`. The event stays, shown withdrawn (who, when, why) by `readEvent` and `timeline` (`withdrawn`); nothing deleted, attestations and relations readable. Dating and correcting stay with `attest`, `recordDatedFact`.

### Uses

- `setup-words`: `word(key, vars)`, every member-facing sentence (plan T50 rule 6; K3668).
- `record-grammar`: `ID_TABLE`, `isHypothesisId` (R6, R39); refusal grammar.
- `jurisdictions`: `governingZone` (its R98; Terms, R23), vote values, `proceeding_flows` (R11, R34).
- `civil-time`: date-times, calendar check, `compare`, `validAt`, day-and-time join (R1, R9, R23, R31, R34).
- `connection-grammar`: shape, owner registry and battery, bounds (R35).
- `record-core`: `getSetting` (`team_time_zone`, by `local-facts` R22; `jurisdiction_profiles`; Terms, R23); `transact`, id allocator, `declareTable`, derived caches (R6, R10, R40); `bundles` contract (its R37: `object_type`), questions (R1, R48; T35-28).
- `membership`: `viewerPredicate`, `listenerRefusal`, `MODULE_ORDER` (R15, R16, R30, R40); question sight (R48; T35-28).
- `promotion`: `registerStep` (events projected from a reading).
- `provenance`: whether a capture is held (R1, R22).
- `reading-pipeline`: `onRead` (R4).
- `extraction`: stated dates and references (R4); `noSha` (R1).
- `content`: extents, capture grade; office metadata (R2, R5); `extentRelation` (its R6), `canonicalExtent` (its R2) for R49 (T36).
- `entities`: `noEntity`, `noSuchEntity`, `has`, `resolutionsFor`, scheme identifiers (R11, R12, R22, R34).
- `legistar-reader`: bodies, persons, events, items, votes, posting times (R22–R25).
- `court-doctypes` (L1): register rows with entry ids (R38).

### Invariants

- **R39** One home per fact, checked at the store's gate: no event, attestation or participant row holds an amount; no payer/payee role; no `HYP-` id in an id field (`isHypothesisId`; K1467); every `when_cache` equals its rebuild.
- **R40** Sight (K1489): an event, dated fact or relation is answered only through attestations whose capture the viewer may see; none visible: neither answered nor counted; testimony in a hidden project stays fenced, uncounted. Tables declared via `record-core.declareTable` with purge, export, sight classes; `when_cache` derived-rebuildable.
- **R41** Absence is never an event; sequence never stored; no event minted only to join two readings of an aggregate (R-3 S-5). No machine row infers a cause, a relation but `within`, or a participant from office holding.
- **R42** (K5292) No place in behaviour, defaults or outward text; vote values and flows from the profile, zone the governing zone (Terms; R23); tests on the fictional test profile.

### Suggestions

- Factory `eventsOf(ctx)` per store (K61); tables `dated_facts`, `events`, `event_attestations`, `event_participants`, `event_relations`, `event_when_cache`, `event_aliases`, `event_choices`.
- Op names BOB's (T33-88; T35); catalogue rows new, promotion's stamp T34's (K1504). R43/R44 are acts beside `createEvent`.
- Open (BOB's): R4's set holder and classes; R5 via `content` or an `office-readers` edge; R22/R23's body-variant map (M-P2 (a)); `proceeding_flows`' shape (T33-2); R14 merging machine rows (proposed yes).
- (T35-34, N644) `duties` links a use's power. (T36-14; K2079) R35 bounds hubs per kind (`connection-grammar.hubBoundOf`), not `BOUNDS.hub`.
- Tests: M-V3's 50-event gold set for R23 (DST both offsets); R24's bound unmoved by a republish; R31 across a day band and a minute; R10, R15, R39 negatives; each refusal with a control. (T37-11; K2207) hub votes from the hub's pages.

- **R55** (T51; K4168; the T51 declaration pass; op-declarations R80, R81; op-grades R49, R50; test-support R15) **Declared ops.** `DECLARED_OPS`, exported beside the ops map: frozen, keyed by door name for `recorddatedfact`, `createevent`, `addparticipant`, `relate`, each `{classes, machineClasses?, mutating, weight, description, fields: {accepts, requires}}`, class, weight, description from the op's rows, fields from the whole arm (stamps and the shell's `reason` are not accepts unless the arm reads its own `reason`); `declaredOpHolds` passes for each with only its requires, fails without each and with a field outside its accepts (`declared-ops.test.mjs`).
- **R56** (T52 R1; W7, the 0.87.0 walk's E-K4) **Under 100 parameters.** Each store statement binds ≤ 99; longer id lists go in parts joined in the service's order, so `timeline` (R28) answers 200 captures as 20 on the shipped store (Durable Object SQLite allows 100).
- **R57** (T52 R1; W7, the 0.87.0 walk's C-K10; amends R28) **Links on timeline items.** Each `timeline` event carries `relations: [{kind, other, withdrawn}]`, each recorded relation with another event (`other` its id, `withdrawn` true if withdrawn), recorded order, on both events, `[]` if none.
