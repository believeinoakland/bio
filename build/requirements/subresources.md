# subresources — requirements

**Status** · DRAFT by BOB #37, 2026-09-25 (T6). Layer 1. Code today: `bio-plane/src/subresources.mjs`. R17 is not yet met: row D-603 (manifest `fetched_at` is stamped on every subresource record, including ones never fetched — reused, policy-skipped, `DEFERRED`, `CAP_REACHED`, `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`, refused — so the record claims a fetch instant nothing was fetched at; `bio-plane/test/subresources.test.mjs:330` currently asserts the unmet behaviour and must be corrected, not exempted, when this is fixed).

## Public

### Purpose

Finds every reference an HTML page needs to render as itself, fetches or reuses each one within this instance's own policy ceilings (never the platform's, which is discovered, not declared), and produces two artifacts from a raw capture's bytes without ever rewriting them: a render companion with scripts and frames removed and every subresource reference replaced by a content-addressed placeholder, and a manifest that resolves those placeholders and states why anything was not fetched. It also gives the other format readers (`office-readers`, `odf-reader`, `pdf-reader`) one shared vocabulary for encoding an outbound link, so every format partitions and wraps a link the same way.

### Provides

**`captureSubresources({ html, base, primarySha, primaryFile, fetchOne, put, sha256, isPublic, cap, perMax, budget, now, platformCeiling, platformMargin, subrequestsAlreadySpent, siteLookup, reuseFreshWindowMs, reuseMinDocuments, readBack, resume, meter }) → Promise<{...}>`.** `fetchOne(url)→{ok,status,bytes,contentType}|{ok:false,...}`, `put(sha,bytes)→{existed}`, `sha256(bytes)→hex`, and `isPublic(url)→boolean` are injected by the caller; nothing here reaches the network or a store on its own. `cap`/`perMax`/`budget` default to `SUBRESOURCE_CAP`/`SUBRESOURCE_MAX`/`SUBRESOURCE_BUDGET`.

- **R1** Every reference the primary HTML makes to render itself is discovered: stylesheet and preload-as-style/image/font links, icons, `<img>`/`<source>`/`<video>`/`<audio>`/`<track>`/`<image>`/`<use>`/image-typed `<input>` (including `srcset`/`imagesrcset` families), inline `style=""` `url()`s, `<style>` block `url()`/`@import` targets (followed one hop through a stylesheet, to depth `CSS_MAX_DEPTH` = 2, then stopped — the primary is depth 0), and `<script src>` (captured, never referenced by the companion). A reference inside an HTML comment is never discovered.
- **R2** A `srcset`/`imagesrcset` family is one reference, not one per candidate: the largest by its `w`/`x` descriptor (a candidate with no descriptor scores 1) is fetched; the rest are recorded `{ok:false, reason:"COLLAPSED_SRCSET_FAMILY"}` and never fetched.
- **R3** References are attempted in fetch-priority order — stylesheets, then css-assets/fonts, then icons, then images, then media, then scripts, a furniture-region reference of the same kind ranking after the document's own — ties broken by discovery order. So when the fanout cap, the byte budget, or the platform ceiling cuts a run short, the reference given up is the least necessary for rendering, never an arbitrary one.
- **R4** Once `cap` references have been attempted, a further one is recorded `{ok:false, reason:"CAP_REACHED", cap}` and not fetched (`manifest.truncated = true`).
- **R5** A fetched body over `perMax` bytes is recorded `{ok:false, reason:"TOO_LARGE", bytes, maxBytes: perMax}` and its bytes are not stored. Once bytes fetched this run reach `budget`, a further reference is recorded `{ok:false, reason:"BUDGET_EXHAUSTED", budgetBytes: budget}` (`manifest.budget_exhausted = true`).
- **R6** A reference whose scheme is `javascript:`, `data:`, `blob:`, `about:`, `mailto:`, `tel:`, `file:`, `ftp:`, `ws:`, `wss:`, `chrome:`, `chrome-extension:`, or `view-source:` is recorded `{ok:false, reason:"REFUSED_SCHEME", scheme}`, never fetched. One that fails to resolve against `base` is recorded `{ok:false, reason:"UNRESOLVABLE"}`. One that resolves but fails `isPublic` — the same fence guarding the primary locator — is recorded `{ok:false, reason:"REFUSED_LOCATOR"}`. None of these consult `fetchOne`.
- **R7** Document boundary: a stylesheet, css-asset, font, or icon is always fetched, whatever region it is in. A cross-origin (`third_party`) script, image, or media is recorded `{ok:false, reason:"THIRD_PARTY"}` and never fetched. A same-origin script inside the document is fetched but never referenced by the companion. An image or media reference found only in a furniture region is recorded `{ok:false, reason:"OUTSIDE_THE_DOCUMENT"}` and never fetched; the same reference found anywhere in a body region is fetched.
- **R8** Region: `<article>`/`<main>` (or `role="article"`/`role="main"`) is `body`; `<nav>`/`<footer>`/`<header>`/`<aside>` (or `role="navigation"|"banner"|"contentinfo"|"complementary"|"search"`) is `furniture`. A declared `role=` outranks the element name. Nesting a furniture element inside a body element makes its contents `body`: body wins over furniture anywhere on the open-element stack, never the innermost tag alone.
- **R9** The same resolved absolute address is fetched at most once per run; a second reference to it resolves to the first's stored record (same `sha256`, same `ok`).
- **R10** With `platformCeiling` set, once `attempted` reaches `platformCeiling - platformMargin - subrequestsAlreadySpent` (`platformMargin` default 5, `subrequestsAlreadySpent` default 1), every further reference is recorded `{ok:false, reason:"DEFERRED"}` and not attempted. If `fetchOne` instead throws with a message naming a subrequest/runtime limit, that and every reference from then on in this run is recorded the same way, `manifest.platform.limited` becomes `true`, and `manifest.platform.observed_ceiling` is set to `attempted + subrequestsAlreadySpent` at the moment it was first hit (otherwise `observed_ceiling` is `null`, meaning only that the ceiling is at least `spent_this_invocation`, never a guess at its true value). Once either has happened once in a run, it is never re-attempted or re-reported in that run.
- **R11** With `siteLookup` supplied, a `stylesheet`/`css-asset`/`font`/`icon` reference `siteLookup` reports as served across at least `reuseMinDocuments` (default 2) distinct document addresses, seen within `reuseFreshWindowMs` (default 24h) of `now()`, is reused at zero fetch cost: its record carries `fetched_this_capture:false`, `reused_from` (the filing capture, or `null` if the record does not name one), and `reused_from_fetched_at`. A script, an image, or media is never reused, whatever `siteLookup` says. With `readBack` supplied and the reused kind a stylesheet within `CSS_MAX_DEPTH`, its own `url()`/`@import` targets are still discovered from the read-back text, exactly as a freshly fetched stylesheet's would be.
- **R12** With `resume` (an earlier tick's `resumeState`), already-recorded records, links, site observations, and `refToUrl` entries are kept, the outstanding queue is restored rather than rediscovered or re-fetched, and each resumed item's earlier `DEFERRED` row is dropped in favour of its new outcome.
- **R13** `resumeState` is non-`null` exactly when something was deferred this run (`outstanding.length > 0`); otherwise it is `null`.
- **R14** The render companion (`companionText`): every element in `script`, `iframe`, `object`, `embed`, `applet`, `frame`, `frameset`, `noembed` is removed with its subtree; every `<base>` and every `http-equiv="refresh"` `<meta>` is removed; every `on*` handler, `integrity`, and `nonce` attribute is removed from every kept element; every subresource reference (including inside `style=""` and `<style>` bodies) is rewritten to `about:capture#<sha256>` when its bytes are held, or to `about:capture#unavailable` when they are not (a script reference always rewrites to `about:capture#unavailable`, whatever it fetched, since a script is captured as evidence and never rendered); a `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` and the derived-artifact banner (naming `primarySha` and `when`) are inserted immediately after the opening `<head>` tag, or at the very top when there is none.
- **R15** Every `<a>`/`<area>` `href` is classified into exactly one of `anchor` (a `#fragment` into the primary itself), `intra` (an address this run already holds bytes for), or `deferred` (any other resolvable, permitted address; its store-membership is NOT decided here and must be re-resolved against the store at read time) — or `refused`, for a scheme this fetches nothing for or a locator `isPublic` refuses. Each distinct `(type, citation-or-address)` pair is recorded once in `links[]`, each entry carrying at least `{ref, type, address, as_of}` plus, as the type requires, `fragment`, `citation` (`normalizeCitation` of the resolved address), `sha256` (intra), `reason`/`scheme` (refused). The wrapper the companion embeds for the link is `linkWrapper[type](...)`.
- **R16** The output resolves to `{ subresources, links, siteObservations, reused, meter, resumeState, manifest, manifestSha, manifestBytes, companionText, companionSha, companionBytes, truncated, discovered, attempted, renditions }`. `subresources` is every reference's record, one each, landing in exactly one of `manifest.counts.fetched` / `failed` (`SOURCE_REFUSED`, `FETCH_FAILED`, `TOO_LARGE`) / `refused` (`REFUSED_SCHEME`, `REFUSED_LOCATOR`, `UNRESOLVABLE`) / `skipped` (`OUTSIDE_THE_DOCUMENT`, `THIRD_PARTY`, `COLLAPSED_SRCSET_FAMILY`, `CAP_REACHED`, `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`, `PLATFORM_LIMIT`, `DEFERRED`) — never two of these, never none. `siteObservations` is one entry per fetched-or-reused resource (`{address, address_norm, sha256, kind, reused, ...}`), for the caller to file. `manifest.complete` is `true` only when nothing was cut short: no platform limit was hit, the cap was not reached, the budget was not exhausted, and nothing is `DEFERRED`; otherwise `false`. `manifest.part_fetch_spread` gives, per clock (`capture` for parts fetched this run, `record` for reused parts, on the Store's clock), the earliest and latest fetch instant among held parts, `two_clocks_not_compared` (with null composite-wide instants) when both clocks hold parts, and counts a held part whose instant is unreadable as `undetermined`, never places it. `renditions` names the render companion and the manifest as two derived files, each with its `sha256`, `bytes`, `content_type`, `transform`, and `reason`.
- **R17** (not yet met — see Status) Only a `subresources[]` record whose fetch was actually issued this run carries `fetched_at`. A reused, policy-skipped, `DEFERRED`, `CAP_REACHED`, `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`, or refused/unresolvable record never claims a fetch instant it does not have.
- Errors: never throws for anything about the reference or the source — a refused scheme, a locator `isPublic` refuses, an oversized body, a cap/budget/platform limit, or a rejected/failed `fetchOne` all become records, never a throw. Throws (a plain JS `TypeError`, uncaught) if `fetchOne`, `put`, `sha256`, or `isPublic` is not called as a function; these have no default and must be supplied.

**`normalizeAddress(url) → string`**
- **R18** The form two resource addresses are compared in: lowercases scheme and host, drops the fragment, drops the port when it is the scheme's default (`443` on `https:`, `80` on `http:`), sorts query parameters by key then value, and leaves everything else — path case, a trailing slash, a cache-busting parameter — untouched.
- Errors: never throws. An unparseable `url` returns `String(url).trim()` unchanged.

**`normalizeCitation(url) → string`**
- **R19** The form a citation (an address plus, optionally, the element within it) is compared in: `normalizeAddress` of everything before the first `#`, with the fragment (if any, once trimmed and non-empty) appended after a `#`. Two links differing only in fragment are two citations; `normalizeAddress` alone would make them one.
- Errors: never throws (delegates to `normalizeAddress`).

**`originOf(url, baseHost) → {origin, host, approximate?}`**
- **R20** `origin` is `"same_host"` when `url`'s hostname equals `baseHost` (case-insensitive); `"same_site"`, with `approximate:true`, when it does not but the last two dot-separated labels match (no public-suffix list, so this is right for a plain two-label domain and wrong for one like `.co.uk`); `"third_party"` otherwise.
- **R21** An unparseable `url` gives `{origin:"unknown", host:null}`.
- Errors: never throws.

**`linkWrapper`** — the four wrapper forms `captureSubresources` and the other format readers embed for a link once its partition is decided:
- **R22** `linkWrapper.anchor(fragment) → fragment`, unchanged.
- **R23** `linkWrapper.intra(sha256) → "about:capture#" + sha256`.
- **R24** `linkWrapper.deferred(url) → "about:link#" + encodeURIComponent(url)`.
- **R25** `linkWrapper.refused() → "about:link#refused"`.
- Errors: never throws.

**`LINK_TYPES` → `["anchor", "intra", "deferred", "refused"]`**
- **R26** The closed, ordered set of partitions `linkWrapper` covers. Nothing else is a link type.

**`SUBRESOURCE_CAP` (400), `SUBRESOURCE_MAX` (8 \* 1024 \* 1024 bytes), `SUBRESOURCE_BUDGET` (64 \* 1024 \* 1024 bytes)**
- **R27** This instance's own appetite ceilings — the default fanout cap, the per-subresource byte ceiling, and the total per-capture byte ceiling — for a capture path to reuse so it spends against the same numbers `captureSubresources` does. Never the platform's own outbound-request limit, which is discovered, not declared (see R10's `platformCeiling`/`observed_ceiling`).

## Private

### Uses

- `runtime-limits`: `makeMeter()` as the default `meter` (`meter.sync(label, fn, bytes)`, `meter.cpuAwait(label, fn, bytes)`, `meter.report()`), so every synchronous compute segment inside `captureSubresources` is timed into `manifest.compute`.

### Invariants

- **R28** No network and no store: every fetch, hash, and write is an injected callback (`fetchOne`, `put`, `sha256`, `readBack`, `siteLookup`). Given the same inputs and callback outputs, `captureSubresources` produces the same records, manifest, and companion.
- **R29** The primary's raw bytes are never rewritten. The render companion is always a *separate* artifact: its own hash, its own first-line banner declaring it derived from `primarySha`, and a CSP that leaves it unable to reach the network or run a script when opened outside a resolving viewer.
- **R30** A subresource fetch can never reach an address the primary capture could not: `isPublic` is the caller's single fence, applied identically to every reference, at every depth.
- **R31** `fetchPolicy`'s CSS exception (stylesheets and their own assets are fetched unconditionally, never region-tested) is deliberate, not a gap: one stylesheet can lay out furniture and body together, and dropping it for being "only chrome" breaks the body's own layout.
- **R32** The honesty fields are never approximated: `fetched_this_capture` is `true` only for a byte fetched during this run; `reused_from`/`reused_from_fetched_at` are `null`/absent rather than guessed when the record does not name a source or an instant; `manifest.platform.observed_ceiling` is `null`, never a documented or remembered number, until this run itself is refused.
- **R33** Every "not fetched" record names which of the closed reason set (R16) it is. None is dropped silently and none is reported as if the source had refused it when this instance chose not to ask.

### Satisfies

- `docs/development/CAPTURE-FIDELITY.md`, whole — subresource capture: the raw/derived split, the document-boundary and region rules, the fanout/byte ceilings, and the render companion's CSP and banner.
- `docs/development/LINK-FIDELITY.md`, whole — a captured page's outbound links are characterised (R15), and `deferred` is stated as store-dependent and re-resolved at read time, never asserted `offsite` at capture.
- CAP-13 and CAP-14 (BOB #21, 2026-09-23) — the two-document reuse floor counts distinct document addresses, and a reused part names the capture that filed it (R11).
- D-191 (BOB #35, 2026-09-25, confirming build `9351b715`) — a composite capture states its temporal spread per clock, never comparing the two (R16's `part_fetch_spread`).

### Suggestions

- R17's fix (D-603): the row's own scope note suggests renaming the unfetched-record field to `considered_at` rather than dropping it outright, so the record still says WHEN this run decided not to fetch something; that name binds nothing here.
- `bio-plane/test/subresources.test.mjs` holds today's tests; `modules.json` places this module's tests at `bio-plane/test/m/subresources/`. Moving them is this module's own job, not a separate row.
- `docs/development/CAPTURE-SCALING.md` (reference, not canon) is the measurement record behind `SUBRESOURCE_CAP`'s history (it documents the `= 45` mistake this module's own top comment also names) and behind the reuse window/floor constants R11 uses as defaults.
