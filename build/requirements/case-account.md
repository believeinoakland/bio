# case-account — requirements

**Status** · DRAFT for BOB, 2026-10-10, on `tranche/T42`. Split from `case-authoring` by copy (K617, K624, K1333, K2608; N839; T42-22), its second split for size, meaning unchanged. Each id names its `case-authoring` source, which retires the moved ids as "moved to case-account R<n>" (BOB's, at T42-23). The extraction map is `build/extraction/case-account-split.md`, its §4 table and §8 readings adopted (K2608). Every requirement is not yet met (T42).

## Public

### Purpose

A case's account (D56, D61): the written account of what the case's evidence shows, and the reviewers' comments a publisher chooses to carry with it. The system drafts the account from the case's cited evidence, in one framing or several (time order, by question, by rule), and may flag the sentences of a member's account that the evidence they cite does not support; each draft is labelled as the system's, machine work when a machine proposed it, and is never the case's account. The member writes the account, from a draft or from nothing, and it is published as hers; when she takes a draft up, how she took it up is recorded, and taking it up as proposed is refused.

This module holds those drafts and acceptances, the account's shape, and the judgment of every sentence of the account and of the case's four statements against what each cites (through `case-disclosures` R30). It also holds the one reader of the review copies' comments, which `review` registers, and the comments the publisher chose. `case-authoring`'s `publishCase` and `publishPreflight` ask it in the order case-authoring R69 states and write what it answers into the case document; this module writes no case document.

### Provides

Terms are `case-authoring`'s and `publication`'s. An **account** is a list of sentences `[{text, cites, bias_statement?}]`; a **cite** is `{kind, ref, ord}`, `kind` one of `case-grammar`'s `ACCOUNT_CITE_KINDS` (a finding, a leg of one with its `ord`, a passage by its `content_id`, a material by its `materials:` ref). A **draft** is a row this module stores from an AI run: `kind` `case_account` (an account's words in one framing) or `account_check` (flags on a member's account). `viewer` and `proposedBy` are the control plane's stamps. Every refusal names `reason`; one with a catalogue row carries its `check`, `code` and `translation`.

#### The system's drafts: accountPropose({case, kind?, framing, text | flags, run, proposedBy, viewer}) (`op=accountpropose`), accountDrafts({case, viewer}) (`op=accountdrafts`)

- **R1** (was `case-authoring` R64, the drafts; D56) *(not yet met: T42)* `accountPropose` stores the system's draft of `case`'s account from `run`, `kind` `case_account` (the default) with `text` in one of `ACCOUNT_FRAMINGS` (`time_order`, `by_question`, `by_rule`). Refusals, in order, each writing nothing:
  - `NO_SUCH_CASE`: a case neither published (`publication`'s `cases`) nor prepared unsigned (its `case_documents`), or one whose project the viewer cannot see, answered alike (R10);
  - `BAD_ACCOUNT_DRAFT` naming the field: an unknown `kind`, or a `text` that is not a string, is blank or is over `ACCOUNT_DRAFT_MAX` (8,000) characters;
  - `BAD_ACCOUNT_FRAMING`: a framing not in `ACCOUNT_FRAMINGS`, naming the allowed ones;
  - `NO_SUCH_RUN`: a `run` that `ai-runs.runFor` does not answer for `viewer`.

  Otherwise it stores one draft under a minted opaque `ACD` id (record-grammar R55; `MINT_EXHAUSTED` through `record-core.mintExhausted` when none is free, nothing written) and answers `{ok: true, draft: {id, case, kind, framing, text, flags, run, label, at}, next}`. The label is `record-grammar.proposalLabel(proposedBy, "case_account")` (its R54), `{by, state, machine_work, says}`: machine work, labelled as machine work, when the proposer is a machine; never the case's account. A label already stored keeps the words it was stored with. Drafts are append-only.
- **R2** (was `case-authoring` R64, K2536) *(not yet met: T42)* `accountPropose` also takes `kind: "account_check"` with `flags: [{ord, text, cites}]` in place of `text` and `framing`: the system's flags on the sentences of a member's account that the evidence they cite does not support. `flags` that are not a list of 1 to `ACCOUNT_SENTENCES_MAX` entries, or an entry without a whole `ord` of at least 1, words on one line of at most `COMPLETENESS_MAX` characters and cites in R5's shape, are `BAD_ACCOUNT_DRAFT` naming the entry, in R1's place among R1's refusals. It is stored the same way, labelled `proposalLabel(proposedBy, "account_check")` (record-grammar R54), and listed by R3. `accountFlags(case, afterDraft)` answers the flags of every `account_check` draft of `case` proposed after the `case_account` draft `afterDraft` names (all of them with none named), in proposal order, each `{kind: "account_check", ord, text, cites}`; it writes nothing.
- **R3** (was `case-authoring` R64, the list) *(not yet met: T42)* `accountDrafts({case, viewer})` lists `case`'s drafts of both kinds, oldest first, each `{id, kind, framing, text, flags, run, label, at}`, at most `ACCOUNT_DRAFTS_MAX` (500), with `truncated` when there are more. `NO_SUCH_CASE` as R1 answers it. It writes nothing.

#### Taking a draft up: accountDraftJudged(accountDraft, caseId, sentences), acceptanceRecorded({caseId, edition, drafted, by, at})

- **R4** (was `case-authoring` R64, taken up; record-grammar R52) *(not yet met: T42)* A member writes the account from a draft or from nothing; the published account is hers. `accountDraftJudged` reads `accountDraft`, a `case_account` draft's id or `{draft, form}`, against the act's sentences (R5's). It answers `{ok: true, draft, framing, form}` (each null when none is named), the form `own_instead` when given so, `as_proposed` when the sentences joined are the draft's words unchanged (white space aside), else the form given, else `edited`. Or, in order:
  - `BAD_ACCOUNT` naming the field: a name that is not a non-blank string, a `form` not one of `record-grammar`'s `ACCEPTANCE_FORMS`, or a draft named for an act that writes no account;
  - `NO_SUCH_ACCOUNT_DRAFT`: no `case_account` draft of `caseId` answers to the name;
  - `ACCEPT_MUST_REAUTHOR`: the form `as_proposed`, answered with `record-grammar`'s one shared row (in `SHARED_ACT_CHECKS`; its R52, whose `where` names this requirement, its R55).

  It writes nothing. `acceptanceRecorded({caseId, edition, drafted, by, at})`, for a `drafted` that names a draft, writes one acceptance in `record-grammar` R52's one shape (`acceptanceRecord({proposal, form, by, at, kind: "case_account"})`) with the case, edition, draft and form, inside the caller's transaction (R9); with no draft named it writes nothing. Acceptances are append-only.

#### The account's shape and its judgment: accountShaped(account, statementCites, excludedCount), accountJudged({…}), citedFor(rows, prepared, reached, viewer)

- **R5** (was `case-authoring` R63, the shape; D56, D57; K2533) *(not yet met: T42)* `accountShaped(account, statementCites, excludedCount)` answers `{ok: true, sentences, statementCites}` or the first refusal, naming the field, with nothing written:
  - `BAD_ACCOUNT`: an `account` that is not a list or holds more than `ACCOUNT_SENTENCES_MAX` (200) sentences; a sentence that is not an object, carries any field but `text`, `cites` and `bias_statement`, or whose `text` is not words on one line of at most `COMPLETENESS_MAX` (2,000) characters; `cites` not a list of at most `ACCOUNT_CITES_MAX` (50) cites, a leg's with a whole `ord` of at least 1 and every other without one, each `ref` non-blank, at most 200 characters, with no quote, backslash or line break; a `bias_statement` blank, over 200 characters or holding a quote, backslash or line break;
  - `BAD_STATEMENT_CITES`: `statementCites` not `{statement, subject_justification, excluded, what_changed}`, a key naming no statement, an `excluded` that is not one list of cites per exclusion row (at most `excludedCount`), or any list of cites malformed as above.

  Absent `account` and `statementCites` are read as none (empty lists).
- **R6** (was `case-authoring` R63, the judgment; D56–D58, D63; K2531, K2533) *(not yet met: T42)* `accountJudged({sentences, statementCites, drafted, statement, justification, excluded, changed, prepared, reached, lens, caseId, viewer})` builds `case-grammar` R23's rows (each account sentence, `kind: account`, in its order, with `began_as` `machine_draft` and its draft when R4's form is `edited`, else `member`; then the four statements: `statement`, `subject_justification`, one `excluded` row per exclusion as the body prints it, and `what_changed` for an edition above 1, each with its cites, a blank one left out) and has them judged by `case-disclosures.accountJudged` (its R30) with:
  - `cited`, what the rows cite as `viewer` reads it (`citedFor`): one holding per distinct cite, `{address, quote}`, its `address` `kind:ref` (a leg's `#ord` after it), its `quote` the finding's live text, the leg as `inquiry.basisFor` states it, the passage's or the material's indexed text; a cite the viewer cannot read, or that names nothing held, has no holding, so its sentence rests on nothing read;
  - `lens`, the lens in force the caller passes;
  - `conclusions`, each prepared member's claim and legs (`inquiry.basisFor`);
  - `flags`, R2's `accountFlags(caseId, drafted.draft)`.

  It answers `{rows, refusals, results, flags, refusal}`: `results` maps each row's `ord` to the codes naming it (empty when it passed), `refusal` the first refusal or null. A judgment that throws or answers no list is `ACCOUNT_CHECK_UNDETERMINED` (fail closed). It writes nothing.

#### The reviewers' comments: registerReviewComments(fn), reviewCommentsChosen(reviewComments, caseId, edition, viewer, draft), reviewCommentBodyLines(given)

- **R7** (was `case-authoring` R66; D61; K2483) *(not yet met: T42)* `registerReviewComments(fn)` takes the one reader of a case's review-copy comments (`review` R33, registered at its start; K31's pattern), once: a second registration is `REVIEW_COMMENTS_DECLARED`, one that is not a function `MALFORMED`, each changing nothing. `reviewCommentsChosen` reads `reviewComments: {included: [comment ids]}` (absent is none) and answers `{ok: true, carried, left_out, block, body}`: the chosen comments, each `{reviewer, text, at}`; `left_out` the count of the case's comments not chosen, or null when undetermined (no reader registered, a list cut at its bound, or a list unread with nothing chosen); `block` `case-grammar` R25's lines (`reviewCommentsLines`). With no reader registered no comment travels. Refusals, each writing nothing: `BAD_REVIEW_COMMENTS` (not `{included}`, not a list of non-blank ids, or more than `REVIEW_COMMENTS_INCLUDED_MAX` (500)); `REVIEW_COMMENTS_UNREAD` (comments chosen and the reader threw or answered no list); `REVIEW_COMMENT_NOT_FOUND`, naming each chosen id not among the case's comments. An objection does not travel unless chosen. `reviewCommentBodyLines(given)` answers the body section a reader reads: each carried comment with its reviewer and when, then how many were left out and that a reviewer left out may file a response in the case's docket, or that the count is undetermined; none when `given` is null. `case-authoring`'s document imports it and keeps no copy (K1333).

#### The instance: caseAccountOf(host, deps)

- **R12** (new; K61; the map's doubt 4) *(not yet met: T42)* `caseAccountOf(host, deps)` answers the one instance for a host: every caller for the same host gets the same instance. `deps` (`record`, `membership`, `inquiry`, `runs`, `disclosures`, `now`) are each reached lazily on the host unless given. At its creation it creates `account_drafts` and `account_acceptances` with the same DDL `case-authoring` created them by (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`), so a running store's drafts and acceptances are kept, with no data move, and declares them (R8). No service of this module throws on another module's failed read: a failed read is answered as R1–R7 state.

## Private

### Uses

- `record-grammar`: `proposalLabel` (its R54 subjects `case_account`, `account_check`; R1, R2), `acceptanceRecord`, `ACCEPTANCE_FORMS`, `ACCEPT_MUST_REAUTHOR`, `SHARED_ACT_CHECKS` (its R52; R4), `parseFrontmatter`.
- `record-core`: `recordOf`, `transact`, `mintOpaqueId`, `mintExhausted` (its R62; R1), `stampInstant`, `declarePurge` (R8), `readFile`; the `bundles` read contract (its R37; R1, R6).
- `membership`: `viewerPredicate` (R1, R6, R10).
- `inquiry`: `basisFor` (R6).
- `content`: the `content` read contract (its R45; R6).
- `extraction`: `capture_text` (its R58, named there by T42-10; R6).
- `publication`: the `cases` and `case_documents` read contracts (its R40; R1, R10).
- `case-grammar`: `ACCOUNT_CITE_KINDS` (R5), `reviewCommentsLines` (its R25; R7).
- `ai-runs`: `runFor` (R1).
- `case-disclosures`: `accountJudged` (its R30; R6). Earlier in the order: this module sits directly after it and directly before `case-authoring` (K2608).
- `test-support`: the tests' fixtures.
- Its users: `case-authoring` calls R4–R7 from `publishCase` and `publishPreflight` (its R63, R67, R68, R69), imports `reviewCommentBodyLines`, creates this module at its own creation, and keeps three one-line pass-throughs (`accountPropose`, `accountDrafts`, `registerReviewComments`) until T43 (N850); `review` registers R7's reader (its R33; T42-23a); `control-plane` reaches R1 and R3 through `of.caseAccount()` (T42-29); `plane` builds it before `caseAuthoringOf` (T42-30); `op-declarations` names it as the two ops' owner (T42-26).

### Invariants

- **R8** (was `case-authoring` R28, its share) *(not yet met: T42)* `account_drafts` and `account_acceptances` are each declared whole to `record-core`'s purge (`declarePurge("case-account", …)`; K23).
- **R9** (a copy of `case-authoring` R18) *(not yet met: T42)* R4–R7's services are synchronous, and every write this module makes (R1, R2, R4's `acceptanceRecorded`) is made through `record-core.transact`, so one made inside a caller's transaction joins it and rolls back with it (`publishPreflight`'s rolled-back run leaves no acceptance).
- **R10** (a copy of `case-authoring` R27) *(not yet met: T42)* A case neither published nor prepared, and a case whose project the viewer cannot see, answer R1 and R3 alike: the same refusal, byte-identical.
- **R11** (a copy of `case-authoring` R30) *(not yet met: T42)* No place is named in this module's behaviour or outward text.

### Satisfies

- D56 (the account: drafted by the system in framings and labelled, written by the member, checked sentence by sentence against what it cites), D57 and D63 (the four statements under the same check; no stories), D58 (framing only under a printed bias statement), D61 (reviewers' comments chosen by the publisher; an objection does not travel), as case-authoring cites them (`draft-T41-investigation.md` §3.6; N820; K2405, K2417, K2418): R1–R7. In the canon: `docs/architecture/BIO_Investigation_v0_1.md` §11 ("The case's account, and nothing but evidence"; "The case's statements about itself"; "Reviewers").
- `docs/architecture/BIO_Publication_v0_1.md` §3 rules 4, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 (preparing the case, its statement, its citations), as `case-authoring` cites them for the moved ids: R5, R6.
- K2536 (the `account_check` flags held with the drafts): R2, R6. K2483 (the review comments read through a registered reader): R7. K2540, N838 (the drafts' labels through `proposalLabel`'s subjects): R1, R2. N839 (case-authoring's second split for size, K617; the map adopted, K2608): R8, R12.

### Suggestions

- **The copy (K624; the map's §2).** From `case-authoring/index.mjs`: the account constants (`ACCOUNT_SENTENCES_MAX`, `ACCOUNT_CITES_MAX`, `ACCOUNT_FRAMINGS`, `ACCOUNT_DRAFT_MAX`, `ACCOUNT_DRAFTS_MAX`, `ACCOUNT_DRAFT_PREFIX`, `ACCOUNT_ACCEPT_KIND`, `REVIEW_COMMENTS_INCLUDED_MAX`), `citeOf`, `citesOf`, `accountShaped`, `citeAddress`, `exclusionSentence`, `namedOrds`, the `runs` slot, `#accountDraftJudged`, `#accountJudged`, `#accountFlags`, `#citedFor`, `#reviewCommentsChosen` with its reader and `registerReviewComments`, and the drafts block (`#caseForDrafts`, `accountPropose`, `accountDrafts`) move to `index.mjs`, each private method made public with its body unchanged (N529's form); the acceptance write becomes `acceptanceRecorded`. `reviewCommentBodyLines` moves to `document.mjs`; the two tables to `schema.mjs` (`CASE_ACCOUNT_TABLES`). Copied and also kept in `case-authoring` (K57): `str`, `refusal`, `#rows`, `#one`, `#when`, `#liveText`, `#preparedProject`, `COMPLETENESS_MAX`. The SQL is unchanged.
- **The label (R1, R2).** `CaseAuthoring.#accountLabel` is not copied: `accountPropose` labels through `proposalLabel(proposedBy, kind)`. The shape is unchanged; only `says` takes R54's sentences.
- **Who creates it (the map's doubt 4).** `case-authoring`'s factory creates it eagerly at its own creation, so both tables exist and are declared at every boot before `plane` names it; `plane` (T42-30) then builds it directly before `caseAuthoringOf`, with `runs: aiRunsOf(ctx, env)`; the fixture builds it first.
- **R7 once (the map's doubt 5).** `review` registers through `case-authoring`'s pass-through until it re-points; a later direct registration reaches the same instance, so no window has two readers.
- **Tests** (`bio-plane/test/m/case-account/`, the map's §6). A fixture copied from `case-authoring`'s without `caseAuthoringOf`; a case published or prepared by writing `cases` and `case_documents` rows directly. Arms port from `account.test.mjs` 165–195 (R1, R3), 259–267 (R2), 137–150 (R5's table), 316–318 (R7's registration) and 152–160 (R6's unseen cite); the label against `proposalLabel` (R54); each refusal a negative control; R9 a rolled-back transaction leaving no row; R10 identical-bytes arms. `case-authoring`'s end-to-end arms stay there, proving its R69.
