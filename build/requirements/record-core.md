# record-core — requirements

**Status** · APPROVED by Bob 2026-09-26 (a product module, P17). DRAFT by BOB #38, 2026-09-26 (P18 preparation), from a drafting worker's reading of the code, reviewed by BOB. Layer 2. Code today: inside the legacy modules `bio-plane/src/store.mjs` and `schema.mjs`; the module is extracted from them by its first job. BOB #40 added `transact`, `commit`, `bundleInfo` and `listBundles` (R32–R35) and gave `auditPass` a caller's visibility predicate, from the promotion and membership reviews (K31). N64 and N66 folded by a drafting worker for BOB #43, 2026-09-26: R49–R55 (`PER_ITEM_MAX`, `perItem`, `manifestByAuthor`, `isFirstBoot`, C-75), not yet met; R37's widening left for Bob (it changes an approved requirement). N40 folded by a drafting worker for BOB #43, 2026-09-26: R56–R58 (`digestCensus`, `snapKeyCensus`, and the one file digest and size they share with `promotion`), not yet met; both censuses read only this module's tables (`files`, `history`, `manifest`, `bundles`), checked at `566bb7f811`. N213 and N219 folded by a drafting worker for BOB, 2026-09-28: R37 widened, R61; met in T9, R37's `group_id` and `prior_state` tested at the contract in T11 (N287). N322 (with N250) folded by a drafting worker for BOB #64, 2026-09-29 (T13, K408): R62 (`mintExhausted`, C-59.6), met with its four callers (K441). folded by a worker for BOB #66, 2026-09-29 (T14 opening; `build/plan/draft-T14-wordings-2.md`, K445): N342 R63 (`registerCounts`, `counts`; rows C-102.13, C-102.14); not yet met. K621 (N408), at T18's opening by a worker for BOB #75, 2026-09-30: R64, `op=stats`' per-class disclosure, written; moved from `store.mjs` in this module's next job (§12.2). T19 layer 2's wordings, by a worker for BOB #80 on `tranche/T19`, 2026-10-01, before layer 2 (rule 6 of `build/plan/current.md`; the seams of `build/extraction/legacy-store.md` §4.2 (1), (3), (4); K650, K653 BOB-6; N422, N426): R68 (`registerAuditFinding`), R69 (`registerAuditContext`), R70 (`registerMintSeed`), R71 (`RECORD_SCHEMA` first) new; R18, R40, R45 re-worded for the registrations; R67 reads `EXTENSION_ARMS` from `record-grammar` (its R28) and states its acceptance for the DEC-49 guard (N422); R34, R37, R44 state the bundle's `project` (N426); two stale Suggestions re-worded. Each marked not yet met (T19 layer 2). Its ops map, by a worker for BOB #80, 2026-10-01 (K757, K758; `build/extraction/legacy-store.md` §4.2 (6)): R72 (`recordCoreOps`, seven ops as today) and R73 (`audit`, with the sight gate `store.mjs`' `auditPass` applies today) new; not yet met (T19 layer 2). AMENDED by BOB #87 at T21's opening (K933): R74's words naming plane's held copy struck (N468; plane R10 met, `held.mjs` deleted, K923); no meaning changed. T23, by a fold worker for BOB #94 at T23's opening, on `fold/T23-b` from `tranche/T23`, 2026-10-02: R37 names `corpus-export` as the reader of `bundles`, `files`, `history` and `manifest` (N484, K1024; the columns were already in the contract, so no change of meaning), its test not yet met (T23 L2). N503 folded by a worker for BOB #98 at T24's opening, 2026-10-02: R75 (`recordOpaqueId`, recording a chosen opaque id in `minted_ids` inside the caller's transaction, refusing one already spent) new; not yet met (T24). T33's fold, by a requirements worker for BOB #114 on `tranche/T32`, 2026-10-05, from plan entry T33-19 (entries C S0-2, S0-3, B0.12; K1470, K1489, K1493; plan Rules (6); the tail and the table census of `measures-T33/assistant-substrate.md` §5, §6): R1 amended (minting from `record-grammar`'s `ID_TABLE`, no ceiling); R21 and R46 amended (`declareTable` with its classes, `declarePurge` kept as its default form); R29 (expunge beside purge) and R40 (both id forms seeded) amended; R76 (the opaque allocator), R77 (the derived-cache convention), R78 (the store-gate hook) and R79 (expunge with a tombstone) added; Uses gains `record-grammar`'s `ID_TABLE`; not yet met (T33-19).

## Public

### Purpose

Owns the record's storage: id allocation, leases, the append-only history and manifest of every
promotion, and purge — the tables and services no later module owns. It holds no member, capability or
fence (`membership`'s share) and no promotion write path (`promotion`'s share); it is what those modules,
and every other module that stores anything, write through and read from.

### Provides

**allocId(prefix, year) → `{id}`**
- **R1** Mints from `record-grammar`'s `ID_TABLE` (its R46). For a sequential prefix (and a prefix the
  table does not hold, as today) it returns `<prefix>-<year>-N`, N the next unused number in the
  `<prefix>-<year>` scope, zero-padded to four digits and never cut, with no ceiling (the 10,000th is
  `…-10000`), and steps that scope's counter so the same number is never returned twice for it again,
  purge or no purge. For an opaque prefix it returns R76's id. The tests allocate the 10,000th id of every
  sequential prefix of `ID_TABLE`, and `entities`' identifier checks accept it (B0.12).
- **R2** Takes the identical step whether called on its own or from inside a caller's own transaction
  (a promotion minting a scoped id as part of a larger write), so the two never diverge.
- Errors: never throws.

**allocIdOp(prefix, year) → `{id}` or refusal**
- **R3** Refuses a prefix in the module's fixed gated set (`PROJ`, `CASE`, `DRAFT`, `RVG`, `TASK`) with
  `ALLOCID_PREFIX_GATED` (C-59.5): those objects' ids are minted by the act that creates them, never
  handed out in advance, because a caller stepping their counter would learn how many exist, hidden ones
  included.
- **R4** Gating is decided on the scope string (`<prefix>-<year>`), never on the prefix alone: a prefix
  that only begins with a gated one's letters keys a different scope and is not refused.
- **R5** A refusal echoes only the prefix and year the caller sent; nothing is allocated.
- Errors: never throws.

**mintOpaqueId(prefix, year, tail, taken) → id or null**
- **R6** Returns `<prefix>-<year>-DDDD<tail>`, DDDD four digits drawn uniformly at random (rejection
  sampling over a CSPRNG so 0000–9999 are equally likely), checked against both the caller's own
  `taken(id)` and every id this service has ever handed out; a collision draws again.
- **R7** Every id returned is recorded, before it is returned, in the same transaction as the call that
  asked for it — never one of the service's own — so a caller whose transaction rolls back takes its
  drawn id back with it.
- **R8** An id once recorded is never drawn again by this service, for any caller, purged store or not
  (D-432): its record of what has been minted is exempt from `purge`, in both the whole-store and the
  single-bundle form.
- **R9** Returns `null` only when 64 draws in a row all collide.
- Errors: never throws.

**recordOpaqueId(id) → `{ok: true, id}` or refusal** (N503)
- **R75** Records `id`, an opaque id its caller chose, in the opaque-id ledger (`minted_ids`) inside the caller's transaction, as R7 records a drawn one: when that transaction rolls back, `id` is not recorded. Once recorded, R6 never draws it and R8 holds for it. Refusals, each recording nothing: an `id` that is not a non-empty string is `OPAQUE_ID_MALFORMED`; an `id` already in the ledger (drawn, recorded or seeded, R40) is `OPAQUE_ID_SPENT`, naming it; a call outside any `transact` (R32) is `OPAQUE_ID_NO_TRANSACTION`. Never throws.

**mintExhausted(prefix, extra?) → refusal** (N322, N250, K275, K392; a module-level function)
- **R62** The one answer to one condition: no free opaque id could be drawn (R6's `mintOpaqueId` answered null, R9). It answers `{ok: false, reason: "MINT_EXHAUSTED", code: "MINT_EXHAUSTED", check, translation, prefix, detail}`: `prefix` the prefix asked: one of R3's gated set, or `SRC`, which `mintOpaqueId` mints opaque but R3 does not gate (N376, K576), `detail` one fixed sentence per prefix naming the id it could not draw (a project, case, draft, grant, task or source id) and saying nothing was written, the same for every caller, and `check` and `translation` its row's. `extra` adds a caller's own fields and never replaces these. Every act of any module that answers this condition answers through it (`promotion` R19, `case-authoring` R7, `review` R27, `tasks` R1, `sources` when it mints a source's id), so the code is minted at one site; its one row is this module's (C-59.6), its `where` naming this function, and review's C-87.12 gives way to it. It writes nothing and never throws.

**registerCounts(module, keys, counts); counts(hid) → figures** (N342, K435; the R59 pattern, for `op=stats` and purge's proof)
- **R63** A module that owns tables registers once, at start, the names of the figures it reports (`keys`, a non-empty list of names) and `counts(hid)`, a synchronous function answering them. `hid` is the caller's `{sql, args}` naming the bundles the caller may not see, or null; this module passes it on and never reads it. `counts(hid)` answers every registered key, in registration order, each the number its module's function gave, or null when that function threw or gave no finite number for it: a figure that could not be read is never zero. A key another registration already holds is refused `COUNTS_DECLARED`, naming the holder, and so is a second registration by the same module; a registration without a module name, a key list or a function is refused `COUNTS_MALFORMED`. A refused registration registers nothing. Each refusal carries its `check` and `translation`: C-102.13 and C-102.14, this module's rows. It writes nothing, and `counts` never throws.

**stats({capacity, viewer}) → counts** (`op=stats`; N408, K621)
- **R64** `stats({capacity, viewer})` answers the instance's counts, each taken through the caller's sight (the bundles `viewer` may not see subtracted, as R63's `hid`; a `viewer` never sent is a direct internal call and counts whole), with the same keys for every class of caller: it never carries a `leads` key nor an `observations` key; it carries the observation log as `observationsNonLead`, the log's rows that are not lead looks, less the rows of runs hidden from the viewer, for every class; and it carries `dbBytes`, the database's size, only when `capacity` is exactly `true` (an absent or other value is false). `capacity` is the one class distinction, set by the control plane from the authenticated class, never by the caller. Purge's proof of what it removed is a separate, private form of the same counts that keeps the whole log as `observations`, with `leads` and `dbBytes`; no route answers it. Writes nothing.

**acquireLease(bundleId, actor, ttlMs) → lease or refusal**
- **R65** `registerStatsSource(module, figures)`: once, at start, one module registers `figures({viewer, proof})`, which answers the instance's figures through the caller's sight; `stats` (R64, `proof: false`) and purge's proof (`proof: true`: whole, keeping `observations`, `leads`, `themes`, `themePlacements`, without `observationsNonLead`, always with `dbBytes`) read it. A second registration is refused `STATS_SOURCE_DECLARED` naming the holder; one without a module name or a function `STATS_SOURCE_MALFORMED`. With none registered, each answers only what this module holds (`dbBytes`, or `{}`). (K621, K645)
- **R66** `afterCommit(fn)`: outside any `transact`, runs `fn` at once. Inside one, holds `fn` and runs it synchronously just after the outermost `transact` has committed, before that call returns, in the order the calls were made. It is dropped when the transaction, or the savepoint holding it, rolls back (a throw or an `ok:false` answer); a savepoint that commits hands its held calls to the one around it. A held `fn` that throws does not undo the commit, stop the other held calls, or change what `transact` answers. A non-function is a `TypeError`. It writes nothing itself. (N406, K645)
- **R67** `registerGrammar(module, {ids, arm})`: once, at start, a later module registers a type grammar for `record-grammar`'s `checkBundle` (`opts.grammars`); `grammars()` answers every registration as `{module, ids, arm}`, in registration order. Refused `GRAMMAR_MALFORMED` (C-102.16): a module that is not a non-empty string; `ids` not a non-empty list of C-ids; an `arm` not a function; ids claiming part of one of `EXTENSION_ARMS` (`record-grammar` R28, read from record-grammar). A registration may claim one or more whole slots, and a slot may be claimed by several registrations, whose arms run in its place in module order (`membership`'s `MODULE_ORDER`); a registration claiming no slot runs after the last (record-grammar R40). Refused `GRAMMAR_DECLARED` (C-102.15), naming the holder: a module's second registration, or an id another registration's grammar holds, except an id of a slot both claim (K766). A refused registration registers nothing. R18 passes `grammars()` as `opts.grammars`; an arm that throws in the audit counts as one `AUDIT_CHECK_FAILED` error on that bundle (R59's rule), never as clean and never as a throw out of `auditPass`. An accepted registration answers `{ok: true, module, ids}`, an acceptance the DEC-49 guard reads as one, never as a refusal without a row (N422). (§1b, K645)
- **R74** (K861, plane R10) The module exports a figure source shaped as R63's `counts(hid)`, with its key list, for `plane` to register under this module's name: `bundles`, `files` and `history`, each less the rows whose `bundle_id` is in `hid`, a NULL key naming no bundle (so never dropped by `hid`); a null `hid` counts whole. The module registers nothing itself. `refs` is `connections`' table and is not this module's figure (R31; K877).
- **R10** Refuses an empty or non-string `actor` with `ANONYMOUS_LEASE`: a lease is never held under no
  name.
- **R11** Refuses when a live, unexpired lease is held by a different actor, and reports who holds it and
  until when.
- **R12** Otherwise takes the lease under the given actor until `ttlMs` from now, replacing any prior
  holder, and returns the bundle's current stored digest as the caller's edit base.
- Errors: never throws.

**releaseLease(bundleId, actor) → `{ok: true, released}` or refusal** (N219)
- **R61** Refuses an empty or non-string `actor` with `ANONYMOUS_LEASE`, as R10. Otherwise, when `actor` holds the lease on `bundleId`, live or expired, ends it and answers `released: true`, so R11 refuses no one on that bundle until a lease is taken again; a lease held by another actor, or none, is left as it is and answered `released: false`. Never throws. (`actions` R16 releases through it, not by `acquireLease(id, actor, 0)`.)

**readFile(bundleId, path) → `{text, sha256}` or `{blobSha, bytes, sha256}` or null**
- **R13** Returns the file's live content when it is stored inline, or its blob reference (never its
  bytes) when it is stored as a blob, read from this module's own tables alone.
- **R14** Returns `null` when the bundle or the path is not held.
- Errors: never throws.

**textAtSha(bundleId, sha) → string or null**
- **R60** Returns the inline text of the bundle's `bundle.md` whose SHA-256 is `sha`, from the live file or, when the live file has moved on, from any historical snapshot of it, read from this module's own tables alone; `null` when either argument is absent, no such text is held, or the file is held only as a blob. Never throws. (The pinned bytes of a case member, which `publication` R2 and `ratification` R3 read; legacy-store's `#memberTextAtSha`, D-442; K94, N69; K203.)

**readImage(bundleId) → `{path → content or blob reference}` or null**
- **R15** Assembles, from this module's own tables alone: every live file; every historical snapshot,
  each named by a fixed derivation from its path and the snapshot key that archived it; and one manifest
  document listing every promotion recorded for the bundle (its key, kind, base, author, created time,
  and the files it touched).
- **R16** Write order is never lost: every manifest entry given back carries `seq`, its rank in the order
  this module recorded the entries, and a caller that needs write order takes it from `seq`, never from
  the snap key. The manifest document itself lists its entries by key, as the catalogue's C-12.1 requires
  (the D-700 form; K65).
- **R17** Returns `null` when the bundle is not held.
- Errors: never throws.

**auditPass({after, limit, visible, context?}) → page report**
- **R18** Runs `checkBundle` (`record-grammar`'s, with `grammars()`, R67) against a bounded page of bundles in id order from
  `after`, and reports, for the page: how many bundles were clean, how many carried an error, and every
  error tallied both by check and by check-and-code.
- **R19** Every reference a check must resolve is resolved against the WHOLE corpus, never the viewer's
  slice of it, so a check never manufactures a dangling-reference finding out of a viewer's position; the
  page returned, and any bundle it names, is limited to the bundles the caller's `visible(bundleId)`
  predicate admits (the sight rule is `membership`'s; this module never decides it).
- **R20** Resumable: the cursor returned is the last bundle id seen on the page, independent of any
  snapshot of the store.
- **R45** `context(bundleId)` answers extra options for that bundle's checks (today the earned and published registries later modules build): every R69 registration's answer for the bundle, merged in registration order, then the caller's own `context` when it gives one; they are passed to the catalogue and to R59's checks with the bundle. This module builds none itself. (K61)
- Errors: never throws.

**declarePurge(module, tables, {exempt?}) → void**
- **R21** A module that owns tables declares them here once, at start, through `declareTable(module, entries)` (S0-3), one entry per table, each naming its classes: `purge` (`clear` or `exempt`), `expunge` (`tombstone`, a row may be removed under R79, or `none`), `export` (`yes`, `admin-only` or `never`; read by `corpus-export`), `sight` (`group`: group-wide; `bundle`: the sight of the bundle its keys name; `source`: the sight of the capture or source a row cites; `owner`: its owner alone), `derive` (`stored` or `derived-rebuildable`, R77) and `version_chain` (`true` when a change appends a version and never overwrites). An entry missing a class, or with a value outside these, is refused `TABLE_CLASS_MISSING` or `TABLE_CLASS_UNKNOWN`, naming the table and the class, and the call registers nothing. `declarePurge(module, tables, {exempt?})` is kept as `declareTable`'s default form (plan T33, Rules (6)): each table `purge` `exempt` when listed in `exempt`, else `clear`; `expunge` `none`; `export` `admin-only`; `sight` `bundle` when the table is keyed to a bundle, else `group`; `derive` `stored`; `version_chain` `false`; a module with a T33 job declares its tables explicitly. `purge` clears every declared table whose `purge` is `clear`; this module's own tables (`bundles`, `files`, `history`, `manifest`, `leases`) are declared by it, with their classes. `declaredTables()` answers every declaration with its classes, in declaration order (`corpus-export` reads it). A table declared twice, or by two modules, is refused with `TABLE_DECLARED`.
- **R46** A declared table is a name, keyed to a bundle by its `bundle_id` column when it has one, or `{name, keys: [columns], whole: "<WHERE clause>"}`: keyed to a bundle by the named columns (any of them matching), and cleared by the whole-store form only where the clause holds. (K61) Under `declareTable` (R21) the same fields sit beside the entry's classes, `{name, keys?, whole?, clears?, purge, expunge, export, sight, derive, version_chain}`, with the same meaning.

**purge({bundleId}) → report** A declaration may also take the form `{name, keys?, clears: [columns]}`: a bundle purge sets each `clears` column to NULL in that table's rows naming the purged bundle, inside the purge's transaction; the whole-store purge is unchanged (K775). *(capture-requests declares `lead_inquiry` with the `clears` form in T19 layer 6)*
- **R22** With no `bundleId`, clears every row of every declared, non-exempt table; with one, clears only the rows keyed to that bundle. A table no module has declared is never touched.
- **R23** Never clears the id counter (`seq`), the opaque-id ledger (`minted_ids`) or a table declared `exempt` (such as the instance's identity and settings), in either form: an id once allocated or minted is never reissued, purged store or not.
- **R24** Reports which form ran (`scope`, `"ALL"` or the bundle id) and a per-table count of what was removed, naming every declared table even when it removed nothing.
- Errors: never throws.

**getSetting(name) → value or null; setSetting(name, value, by) → void**
- **R25** Holds the instance's settings as named values, each recorded with who set it and when. `getSetting` returns the value last set, or `null` when none was. Settings are exempt from `purge`.
- **R26** The instance's active jurisdiction profiles are the setting `jurisdiction_profiles`: an ordered list of profile ids, which a consumer passes to `jurisdictions.combine`.

**transact(fn) → fn's result**
- **R32** Runs `fn` as one transaction over the whole store: when `fn` throws or returns a refusal
  (`ok:false`), every row written inside it, in any module's tables, is rolled back, and no id allocated
  inside it is spent. This holds for a nested call too: it joins the outer transaction, and a
  nested call that throws or refuses rolls back its own writes and ids (a savepoint), while the outer
  call decides the rest.
- Errors: rethrows what `fn` throws, after the rollback.

**commit({bundleId, type, title, project, snapKey, kind, base, author, writer, operation, files, state, priorState, group, created, lastUpdated, criticality, at}) → `{bundleSha, rowVersion}`**
- **R33** The one write path into this module's tables, called inside `transact`: it copies every live
  file the commit replaces into `history` under `snapKey`, writes the new live files (inline text, or a
  blob reference), sets the bundle's row, and appends exactly one `manifest` entry recording the key,
  kind, base, author, time, writer, operation and each file's digest. It never modifies or removes an
  existing `history` row or `manifest` entry. What may be committed is decided by its caller
  (`promotion`), never here.
- **R44** The bundle's row records `project`, `state`, `priorState`, `group`, `created`, `lastUpdated` and `criticality` as the caller gives them, and the manifest entry's time is `at`, the caller's stated time. (K61)
- Errors: never throws for a well-formed call.

**bundleInfo(bundleId) → `{id, type, title, project}` or null; listBundles({project, after, limit}) → `{ids, cursor}`**
- **R34** `bundleInfo` answers a held bundle's type, title and project from this module's tables, or
  `null` when it is not held. `project` is the project id the last `commit` of the bundle named (R44), `null` for a bundle that belongs to no project.
- **R35** `listBundles` lists held bundle ids in id order after `after`, limited to `project` when
  given, at most `limit`; `cursor` is the last id listed.
- Errors: never throws.

**listByType({type, after, limit}) → `{ids, cursor}`; the `bundles` read contract; evidenceStore() → `{head, get, put}`** (K57)
- **R36** `listByType` lists held bundle ids of one `object_type` in id order after `after`, at most `limit`; `cursor` is the last id listed. Never throws.
- **R37** The table `bundles` and its columns `bundle_id` and `object_type` are a stated read contract: a later module may join them in its own SQL (a projection bounded by SQL, as membership's directory is, D-497), and this module changes neither column's name, type or meaning without a requirement change carried to every such reader (P5). The columns `current_state`, `title` and `criticality` are part of it too, on the same terms (N64, K96: `affordances` and `queue` read them). The tables `files` and `history`, with their columns `bundle_id`, `path` and `sha256` (and `history.snap_key`), and the columns `bundles.created` and `bundles.last_updated`, are part of it too, on the same terms (N83: `provenance` reads them). The column `files.content`, the live file's inline text exactly as `commit` was given it and NULL when the file is blob-backed (`blob_sha` set), is part of it too, on the same terms (N162, K233: `reevaluation`, `inquiry`, `retrieval` and `run-productions` scan it). The columns `files.bytes` (the live file's size in bytes as `commit` recorded it) and `files.blob_sha` (the blob address of a blob-backed file, NULL for an inline one), `bundles.bundle_sha` and `bundles.row_version` (R41's `bundleSha` and `rowVersion`), `history.created`, and the table `manifest` with its columns `bundle_id`, `snap_key`, `kind`, `base`, `author`, `created`, `writer` and `operation` (R42's entry), are part of it too, on the same terms, and so is `manifest`'s `rowid`, which ranks a bundle's entries in the order this module recorded them (R16; the tie-break under `created` those readers use) (N213, N484: `corpus-export`'s working-corpus export, its R1, moved from `publication` by K1024, reads `bundles`' `bundle_id`, `object_type`, `title`, `current_state`, `bundle_sha`, `row_version`, `created` and `last_updated`, `files`' `path`, `sha256`, `bytes`, `blob_sha` and whether `content` is set, `manifest`'s columns and `rowid`, and `history`'s `snap_key`, `path`, `sha256` and `created`; `ratification`'s rows read them). The columns `bundles.group_id` (R44's `group`: the producing group as the committer gave it, kept when a later commit gives none; the empty string for a bundle created naming none) and `bundles.prior_state` (R44's `priorState` as last given; NULL when none was given at creation) are part of it too, on the same terms (N287: `retrieval`'s `projection`, `query-language`'s `bundles` relation and `inquiry`'s `divide` read them). The column `bundles.project` (R34's `project`) is part of it too, on the same terms (N426: `membership`'s `viewerPredicate`, its R43, fences a bundle that belongs to a project by it). No other column is part of the contract. The projection columns on `bundles` and `fts_id` are `retrieval`'s (its migrate declares them and only its projection writes them), not this module's, until they move to a table of retrieval's own (K144, N106).
- **R38** `evidenceStore()` answers the instance's evidence store (R2 bucket) as `{head(key), get(key), put(key, bytes)}`, the object key of a digest being fixed by this module; `null` when the instance has none bound, so callers answer undetermined (provenance R8–R9).

**How the module is reached: recordOf(ctx, opts?) → the instance** (K61)
- **R39** Answers the one instance of this module for a Durable Object's storage (`ctx.storage`, with its `sql` and `transactionSync`): every caller in the object gets the same instance, so all share one transaction depth, one purge declaration list and one evidence binding. `opts` (`{evidence, evidencePrefix}`) is read on the first call only. The services above are its methods, by their names.

**seedMintLedger(sources) → void** (K61)
- **R40** Before the first mint, seeds the opaque-id ledger with the ids live in the tables and columns its caller names (`[[prefix, table, column], …]`) and in every source registered by R70, each named by that table's owner as `declarePurge`'s tables are. It reads nothing else of another module's tables: R31 allows a declared table to be reached only as its declaration says (K1542). Ids of both `ID_TABLE` forms are seeded: a sequential id of any counter width and an opaque id with its 16-character tail (S0-2).

**head(bundleId), manifestEntry(bundleId, snapKey), livePaths(bundleId)** (K61)
- **R41** `head` answers a held bundle's `{bundleSha, rowVersion, type, title, currentState, priorState, groupId}`, or `null`.
- **R42** `manifestEntry` answers the manifest entry recorded under `snapKey` as `{kind, base, author, created, files, writer, operation}`, or `null`.
- **R43** `livePaths` answers the paths of a held bundle's live files in path order, or `null` when the bundle is not held. None of the three throws.

**stampInstant(precision, when?) → string; instantOrder(a, b) → number** (N58, K85; module-level functions, not methods)
- **R47** `stampInstant` spells the instant `when` (milliseconds since the epoch, default now) in UTC as ISO 8601: `"second"` gives `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`, `"millisecond"` gives `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ`; any other precision throws, naming it.
- **R48** `instantOrder` compares two instants in either spelling as instants, never as strings (`…:00Z` is before `…:00.123Z`): negative, zero or positive as a comparator, and NaN when either side is not a non-empty readable instant. Never throws.

**PER_ITEM_MAX; perItem(act, body, stamped, one, {itemKeys, sharedKeys}) → answer** (N64, K91 (4): the set form of an act, generic over its identity groups)
- **R49** `PER_ITEM_MAX` is 100, the most items one set may carry; `affordances` re-exports it unchanged.
- **R50** `perItem` applies `one` to each item of `body.items` on its own. Refused whole, before any item is
  tried, with `op` (= `act`), `weight: "per-item"` and `count`: `items` absent, not an array or empty,
  `SET_NO_ITEMS` (C-75.1); more than `PER_ITEM_MAX` items, `SET_TOO_LARGE` (C-75.2) with `max`. Otherwise each
  item in order, whatever became of the others: one that is not an object is retained as
  `SET_ITEM_MALFORMED` (C-75.3); else `one` is called once with the rest of `body` (the shared values), then
  the item's own fields, then `stamped` over both, and no `items`; a call that throws is retained as
  `SET_ITEM_FAILED` (C-75.4); an answer with `ok: true` is `applied`, any other is `retained` carrying that
  answer's own fields verbatim. Every outcome is `{index, outcome, asked, …}`, `asked` the item's scalar
  fields (strings cut at 400 characters), so `applied + retained = count`.
- **R51** Identity groups: a key in some group of `itemKeys` and not in `sharedKeys` is an identity key. An
  item that names an identity key (a trimmed, non-empty string) receives the shared values of every key in
  the groups it names, and no shared value of any other identity key; an item that names none receives the
  shared values whole. With no `itemKeys` nothing is narrowed.
- **R52** The answer is `{ok: true, op, weight: "per-item", count, applied, retained: 0, items, detail}`
  when every item applied, else `SET_ITEMS_RETAINED` (C-75.5) with the same fields beside it. Items are not
  one transaction: an applied item stands whatever a later one does. Every refusal carries its `check` and
  `translation`. `perItem` itself writes nothing and never throws.

**manifestByAuthor({authorPrefix, after, limit}) → `{bundles, cursor}`** (N64: the manifest read `queue`'s
unattended-capture producer needs)
- **R53** Lists, in id order after `after` and at most `limit`, each held bundle with at least one manifest
  entry whose author begins with `authorPrefix`, as `{bundleId, latest, firstOther}`: `latest` is its latest
  entry `{snapKey, kind, base, author, created, writer, operation}`, ordered by `created` and then by the
  order this module recorded the entries; `firstOther` is its earliest entry, in the same order, whose
  author is non-empty and does not begin with `authorPrefix`, or `null`. `cursor` is the last id listed.
  Which of them a viewer may see is the caller's to decide (`membership`), as for R19. Never throws.
 

**isFirstBoot() → boolean** (N66)
- **R54** `true` throughout the boot at which the store had never held the record's schema (no `bundles`
  table before this module created its tables), and `false` at every later boot. It is decided once, before
  any table is created or altered, and never throws. `instance-setup` reads it (its R2, R13).
 

**digestCensus({limit}) → report; snapKeyCensus({limit}) → report** (N40, K72 (12): read-only audits of this module's own tables, `op=digestcensus` and `op=snapkeycensus`)
- **R56** `digestCensus` answers `{ok: true, files, history, rewritten: 0, note}`, one part for the live files and one for the historical snapshots, each `{rows, inline, blob, digest_disagrees, bytes_disagree, listed}`. A row's digest disagrees when its stored digest, lower-cased, differs from the digest R58 computes from its stored content; a row with neither text nor blob address is not judged. A live inline row's size disagrees when its stored size differs from R58's size of its text; historical rows hold no size and are not judged for it. `listed` holds at most `limit` disagreeing rows per part, each `{bundle_id, snap_key (historical rows), path, stored, computed, bytes_stored (only when the size disagrees), digest: "disagrees" | "agrees"}`; the counts are always whole. `limit` is an integer from 0 to 500 (a larger one is 500, a negative one 0), and 50 when absent, empty or not an integer. It writes nothing, repairs nothing and never throws.
- **R57** `snapKeyCensus` answers `{ok: true, bundles, manifest_rows, promotions, overwritten, undetermined, bundles_with_deficit, excess, orphan_manifest_bundles, listed, rewritten: 0, note}`. For each held bundle its promotions are its `rowVersion` (one per `commit`, R33) and its deficit is promotions less its manifest entries: a negative deficit adds to `excess`; a positive one counts toward `bundles_with_deficit` and is split into `undetermined` (1 when the bundle has no creation entry, one whose `base` is the SHA-256 of the empty string, else 0) and `overwritten` (the rest). Its `unanchored` entries are the snap keys of its non-creation entries whose `base` is not the `bundle.md` digest recorded by any of its own entries (an entry's file list that does not parse counts as empty). A bundle with a positive deficit or any unanchored entry is listed, at most `limit` of them, as `{bundle_id, promotions, manifest_rows, overwritten, undetermined, creation_row, unanchored}`. Manifest entries of a bundle id not held add to `manifest_rows` and count once per id in `orphan_manifest_bundles`. `limit` as R56. It writes nothing and never throws.
- **R58** `fileDigestOf(f)` answers the SHA-256, lowercase hex, of the UTF-8 bytes of an inline file's `text` exactly as given (no trimming, no line-ending change), or a blob-backed file's `blobSha` lower-cased, or `null` for neither; `inlineBytesOf(f)` answers the UTF-8 length of an inline file's `text`, or `null` for a blob. They are module-level functions, and the one computation of a file's digest and size: `promotion`'s digest and size checks and R56 read them, so the door and the census cannot disagree about what a disagreement is (REC-175, REC-178).

**registerAuditCheck(module, check)** (N51, K130: the K31 pattern for audit checks)
- **R59** A later module registers, once at its start, an audit check `check(image, context)` over the same image `checkBundle` gets, with R19's whole-corpus resolution and R45's context. `auditPass` runs the catalogue and then every registered check on each bundle of the page, and counts a bundle's errors once in its clean and with-errors counts, its tallies and its offenders. A second registration by the same module is refused `AUDIT_CHECK_DECLARED`, a registration that is not a module name and a function `AUDIT_CHECK_MALFORMED`; a check that throws counts as one error `AUDIT_CHECK_FAILED` on that bundle, never as clean.

**registerAuditFinding(module, key, finding); registerAuditContext(module, context)** (`build/extraction/legacy-store.md` §4.2 (1): the seams `auditPass` needs to leave the legacy store)
- **R68** A later module registers once, at start, a page finding `finding(page)` under its answer key `key`: `page` is the audit's page, each bundle `{bundleId, type, state}` in id order, with `after` and the last id. `auditPass` calls every registered finding once per page, in registration order, and its answer carries each one's result under its `key`, beside and never inside `ok`, `clean`, `withErrors`, `tally` and `offenders`, which a finding never moves (a stated finding, not a conformance error: `provenance-routes`' route-marker tally as `route` (its R6; `provenance` R54 before N512's split), membership's reserved-id finding as `membership`). A finding that throws is answered under its key as `{ok: false, reason: "AUDIT_CHECK_FAILED"}`, never omitted and never a throw out of `auditPass`. A second registration by the same module, or a `key` another registration or the answer's own fields hold, is refused `AUDIT_CHECK_DECLARED` (R59's row) naming the holder; one without a module name, a non-empty `key` or a function, `AUDIT_CHECK_MALFORMED`. A refused registration registers nothing.
- **R69** A later module registers once, at start, `context(bundleId)`, answering an object of options for that bundle's checks (inquiry's earned registry, publication's published registry); R45 merges every registration's answer. A second registration by the same module is refused `AUDIT_CHECK_DECLARED`; one without a module name or a function, `AUDIT_CHECK_MALFORMED` (R59's rows). A context that throws gives that bundle nothing from it and is counted as R59's `AUDIT_CHECK_FAILED` on that bundle, never as clean.

**registerMintSeed(module, sources)** (`build/extraction/legacy-store.md` §4.2 (3))
- **R70** A later module whose table holds opaque ids registers once, at start, its seed sources (`[[prefix, table, column], …]`, its own tables only: ratification's `cases` and `case_documents`, publication's `published_cases` and `published_case_members`), and R40 seeds from them as from its caller's. A second registration by the same module, or a malformed one (no module name, or a source that is not three non-empty strings), is refused `MINT_SEED_DECLARED` or `MINT_SEED_MALFORMED`; a refused registration registers nothing.

**migrate() runs `RECORD_SCHEMA` first** (`build/extraction/legacy-store.md` §4.2 (4))
- **R71** This module runs its own schema (`RECORD_SCHEMA`: `bundles`, `files`, `history`, `manifest`, `leases`, `seq`, `minted_ids`, `settings`, and from T33 `tombstones` and `derived_stale`, K1542) and its own migrations (the manifest's `writer` and `operation` columns, the `classification` drop, the type-alias normalisation of `bundles.object_type` through `record-grammar`'s `LEGACY_TYPE_ALIASES`, the second additive pass) in its `migrate()`, and the composition root calls it before any other module's `migrate`, so `bundles` exists before any module reads it. Running it twice changes nothing.

**recordCoreOps(record, url, body, {sight}) → ops map** (`build/extraction/legacy-store.md` §4.2 (6), §4.4 (2); `build/plan/current.md` rule 5; the `membershipOps` pattern; K757)
- **R72** The module publishes `recordCoreOps(record, url, body, {sight})`, an object of route arms keyed by op name, each a function of no arguments that answers what the named service answers, reading its parameters from `url`'s query (the control plane's stamps among them, never the body's). It holds seven ops, each with its behaviour under this module's own route map (N511, K1221; no change of meaning): `allocid`, `allocIdOp(prefix, year)` from `prefix` and `year` (R1–R5); `lease`, `acquireLease(id, actor, 300000)` from `id` and `actor`, a lease of five minutes (R10–R12); `snapkeycensus`, `snapKeyCensus({limit})` (R57); `digestcensus`, `digestCensus({limit})` (R56); `stats`, `stats({capacity, viewer})` with `capacity` true exactly when the query's `capacity` is `1` (the control plane's stamp, its R40) and `viewer` the stamped one, or not sent when the query holds none (R64, R65); `audit` (R73); `purge`, from `bundleId` (absent or empty is the whole store): in one `transact` (R32) it runs `purge({bundleId})` (R22–R24), the capture requests whose `lead_inquiry` names a purged bundle having it cleared (`capture-requests` R35, by its own declaration or hook, never by a call from this module), and answers `{ok: true, scope, before, after, removed}`, `scope` R24's, `before` and `after` purge's private proof read just before and just after (R64, R65), and `removed` for each of the keys `bundles`, `files`, `history`, `refs`, `register`, `tasks`, `taskQueue`, `sourceReachability`, `entities`, `entityAliases`, `entityRelations`, `resolutions`, `connections`, `progressionDefs`, `connectionPairChoices`, `progressionStages`, `progressionDefVersions`, `progressionStageVersions`, `progressionInstances`, `progressionExceptions`, `connectionDirty`, `proposalDispositions`, `queueState`, `projectParticipants`, `projectOwnerVotes`, `aiRuns`, `aiRunBounds`, `aiRunLog`, `leads`, `themes`, `themePlacements`, `suggestRefusals` and `captureRequests` its `before` less its `after`. Which credential reaches each op, and the stamps, are `op-declarations`' and `control-plane`'s (its R17, R40), never this map's. `legacy-store`'s own job replaces its seven explicit arms by one spread of the map (K671).
- **R73** `audit` answers today's sweep, gated by the caller's sight as this module's `auditPass` gates it (N511, K1221; no change of meaning): R18–R20 over the page from `after` (empty when absent), at most `limit`, with `visible(id)` true exactly when the bundle passes `sight(viewer)`, `viewer` the control plane's stamp (control-plane R17; `audit` is among its viewer-stamped reads) and `sight` `membership`'s `viewerPredicate` (its R43), the one sight rule, handed to the map by the composition root because this module uses no `membership` (R19: it never decides sight). Each id the page names is asked once; references still resolve against the whole corpus (R19). An absent or unknown `viewer` sees nothing, so its page is empty and its `total` 0 (fail closed, R43's "any other viewer"). The answer is `{ok: true, checked, clean, withErrors, tally, tallyDetail?, offenders, limit, cursor, total}` (R18, R20, R59), with every R68 finding under its key (`route`, `membership`) and R45's context from R69's registrations, where `total` is the count of held bundles `sight(viewer)` admits and the page's ids themselves are not answered.

**T33: the opaque allocator, derived caches, the store gate, expunge** (T33-19; S0-2, S0-3, B0.12; K1470, K1489, K1493)
- **R76** (S0-2) For a prefix `ID_TABLE` names `opaque` (`EVT`, `LIN`, `MNY`, `PFA`, `IDC`), `allocId(prefix, year)` (and `allocIdOp`, R3–R5) returns `<prefix>-<year>-<tail>`, the tail 16 characters of `[a-z0-9]`, each drawn uniformly from a CSPRNG (rejection sampling). The id is checked against the opaque-id ledger and recorded there inside the caller's transaction before it is returned, as R7 records a drawn id, so a rolled-back transaction takes it back and R8 holds for it; a hit on the ledger draws again, so a collision is a retry and never a duplicate (`measures-T33/assistant-substrate.md` §5). After 64 hits in a row it answers R62's `MINT_EXHAUSTED` for that prefix. Never throws.
- **R77** (S0-3; the derived-cache convention) A table declared `derive: "derived-rebuildable"` names, at declaration, `rebuild(scope)`, which recomputes its rows from the stored rows they derive from (`when_cache`, `bound_cache`, the identity cluster, check results and the like). `rebuildAndCompare(module, table, scope?)`, the one test helper, rebuilds the rows into a scratch copy and compares them byte for byte with the held rows, answering `{same: true}` or `{same: false, first: {key, held, rebuilt}}`; it writes nothing to the held table. `markStale(module, table, key)` marks a held row stale inside the caller's transaction, and `readDerived(module, table, key)` answers a stale or missing row as `{stale: true}`, never its held value (fail-closed), until a rebuild clears it. A derived-rebuildable table travels in an export as its rule, never its rows (`corpus-export`).
- **R78** (S0-3; the one-home checks) `registerStoreGate(module, table, check)`: once per table, at start, the table's owner registers `check(row, {op})`, its one-home and shape checks (no amount in an event row, no `HYP-` id in a field naming an id, no total stored, and the like). `storeGate(module, table, row, op)`, which every write to a gated table calls inside its transaction before the write, runs the table's checks in registration order and answers the first refusal, with its `code`, or `null`; a writer that gets a refusal writes nothing and answers it. A second registration for one table is refused `STORE_GATE_DECLARED`, naming the holder; one without a module, a declared table or a function `STORE_GATE_MALFORMED`. A check that throws is a refusal `STORE_GATE_FAILED`, never a pass.
- **R79** (K1493; State Rules I-19, the sanctioned exception to append-only) `expunge({module, table, key, ground, order?, demandKind?, by})` removes, inside one transaction, the rows of a table declared `expunge: "tombstone"` whose keys match `key`, and records one tombstone `{table, key, ground, order?, demandKind?, by, at}` holding none of the removed content. `ground` is one of `unlawful`, `confidential`, `court_order` (naming the recorded order in `order`) or `lawful_demand` (naming the profile's demand kind in `demandKind`, which its caller has checked against the active profiles); any other ground is refused `EXPUNGE_GROUND_UNKNOWN`, a table not declared `tombstone` `EXPUNGE_NOT_DECLARED`, a machine or absent `by` `EXPUNGE_NOT_A_MEMBER`, and a `key` matching no row `EXPUNGE_NOTHING`, each removing nothing. Tombstones are append-only, never removed by `purge` (in either form) or by another expunge, and `tombstones({table, after, limit})` lists them in the order recorded (`corpus-export` and later editions read them, so a removal reaches future exports). Who may expunge, and the grounds' evidence, are the caller's (`people` R12; `docket` for a court order).

## Private

### Uses

- `record-grammar`: `checkBundle`, `EXTENSION_ARMS` (R67), `createSha256`, `LEGACY_TYPE_ALIASES` (R71), `ID_TABLE` (R1, R40, R76; T33-19).
- No use of `membership`: the sight R73 applies is `viewerPredicate`, handed to `recordCoreOps` by the composition root.
- `id-spaces` is a permitted dependency (`build/layers.md`) but nothing in this module's share calls it
  today.

### Invariants

- **R27** **C-59.5.** A caller never allocates a sequential id for a gated prefix (`PROJ`, `CASE`,
  `DRAFT`, `RVG`, `TASK`); those objects' ids are opaque and minted only by the act that creates them.
- **R28** An id this module has allocated or minted is never handed out to a second object, by any path,
  purged store or not (D-432).
- **R29** `history` and `manifest` are append-only: `commit` (R33) only appends to them, no service of
  this module modifies or deletes a row of either, and the only sanctioned removal is `purge`. `expunge` (R79) removes rows only from tables declared `expunge: "tombstone"`, never from `history` or `manifest`, and leaves its tombstone.
- **R30** A lease is never held under an anonymous actor (R10 restated as the rule the module keeps, not
  merely the shape of one refusal).
- **R31** Every service of this module reads and writes only this module's own tables and the system
  clock; a table another module declared to it is reached only as its declaration says (`purge` clears it, R21; `expunge: "tombstone"` removes its rows, R79; `derive: "derived-rebuildable"` reads and rebuilds it, R77; R40 seeds from it; K1542); it makes no network call and holds no member, capability or fence.
- **R55** **C-75.** The set form's five refusals (R50, R52) move here as an invariant with their test
  (K6): C-75.1–C-75.5.

### Suggestions

- `#mintProjectId`'s slug derivation is project-specific; whether it stays here (a thin wrapper over
  `mintOpaqueId`) or moves to `promotion` (the module that actually mints `PROJ` ids) is an open
  extraction question, not a requirement.
- **R26's writer** is `instance-setup`: its R13 at the first boot (reading R54) and its R14 after (K93, N66).
- **`perItem`'s callers** (R50) are `entities` (`op=resolve`) and `queue` (`taskresolve`, `taskforward`,
  `proposedispose`), each passing its act's published identity groups (`affordances`' `PER_ITEM_ACTS`).
- **The censuses (N40).** The creation marker (the SHA-256 of the empty string) is defined here for R57; `promotion` exports its own `EMPTY_STRING_SHA` today and can import this module's. `promotion`'s `fileDigestOf` and `inlineBytesOf` (its `promotion/index.mjs`) give way to R58's, a change in `promotion` its next job makes (an entry for it). `homeCensus`, beside them in the store, reads provenance's `register` and is not this module's.
- C-59.6 is held in this module's own row table (K174), beside C-59.5, which stays in the catalogue until it moves here.
- **T33 (T33-19).** The default classes of `declarePurge` (R21) are this file's choice for modules with no T33 job (Rules (6): no sweep job; P8); each module's next job declares its classes explicitly. Tables that hold secrets or person links are declared `export: "never"` by their owners (`credentials`, `people`). The 10,000th-id tests and R77's byte comparison are measured inside this job (plan T33, Measurements).
- `counts`' reader is this module's own `stats` and purge's proof (R64, R65; K621, K650), not `legacy-store`'s `#counts`.
- `purge` today clears some 40 tables in one method, most of them other modules' (entities, connections, progressions, ai-runs and more). Under R21 each module declares its own tables; since T18 every table is declared by its owner and the legacy store declares none (K720, `build/extraction/legacy-store.md` §3).
