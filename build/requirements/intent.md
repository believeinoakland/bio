# intent — requirements

**Status** · In force: approved by Bob 2026-09-26 (K102), with later folds reviewed; C-111.16 is retired, its number not reused (K446). Last changed T33 (T33-58: R4 amended; R31 new; K1471); every requirement met (K1629). Last changed T41 (T41-32's text: R32, R33 new; N820; D13, H30 (1); K2405, K2417, K2418); marked not yet met (T41).

**Size (P6).** About 3 lines move today (C-2.9's objective arm). The module is written new from this file; its first job reports its size. Nothing here suggests it approaches 4,000.

## Public

### Purpose

Intent holds what the group is trying to achieve and turns it into checkable work (Content Framework §12): **aspirations** (standing, never close, set priority), **goals** (bounded pursuits that close eventually) and **objectives** (a project's aim, with a satisfaction condition the record is measured against). Progress on an objective is computed from the record and never reported; its gaps are the work list. Unasked-for findings arrive as proposals, and only a member's act adopts one, opens a question from it, or sets it aside with a recorded reason (the discovery loop).

### Provides

Terms. An **aspiration** is `{id, scope, owner, statement, entities, progressions, state, author, at}`, `scope` one of `group`, `project`, `member`, `owner` the project or member id (none for `group`), `state` `held` or `retired`. A **goal** is `{id, statement, bounds, aspiration, objectives, state, closed_reason, author, at}`, `state` `open` or `closed`. An **objective** is a project's `objective` text with an optional **condition** `{progression, entity, relation, filter, required: {grade, stages}, satisfied: {share}}`. A **proposal** is an unasked-for finding a registered source offers: `{key, source, kind, grade, basis, instances, surfaced_by}`. A **machine** is a credential with no person behind it.

**The objective's text** (a check registered with `promotion`, its R39; K31)
- **R1** A promotion of a project whose document states no `objective`, or an empty one, is refused (C-2.9, its objective arm).
- **R29** (K653 BOB-4; K899 (3), N317) C-2.9's `closed_reason` arm is this module's grammar, registered once at start through record-core's grammar seam (`registerGrammar`, record-core R67) in record-grammar R28's `checkProjectExtension` slot, which it claims whole (`C-2.9`; record-grammar's slot no longer holds `C-9.1`, K930; K935) so that `checkBundle` runs it at that slot's place. For a document whose `object_type` is `project` (any other: nothing), at `closed`, a `closed_reason` not one of `resolved`, `superseded`, `abandoned` is one C-2.9 error. `workproduct_state`, `evaluations` and the readiness ladder (C-9.1) are not read (Bob, K899 (3): a project's stage and its work products' readiness are computed, `project-stage` R2–R4); a document carrying them is neither refused nor corrected for them.

**setCondition({project, condition, reason, author, viewer}) → `{ok, project, condition, at}` or refusal**
- **R2** Refusals in order: `MACHINE_CANNOT_SET_OBJECTIVE` (an empty or machine author); `NO_SUCH_PROJECT` (absent or not visible to the viewer, one answer); `PROJECT_ACT_NOT_A_PARTICIPANT` (`membership.projectAuthority`, `joined`); `INTENT_NO_REASON` (R30: the `reason`, the author's words on why progress is measured this way, absent, not a string or blank, as R8's; a removal included; DEC-88, K1025); `CONDITION_UNREADABLE` (not the shape above); `INTENT_NO_SUCH_PROGRESSION` (R30); `NO_SUCH_ENTITY`; `INTENT_BAD_STAGE` (a required stage the progression does not declare; R30); `CONDITION_BAD_GRADE` (not A–D); `BAD_SHARE` (not an integer 1–100). A null condition removes it. Success writes a new revision of the project document through `promotion` carrying the condition (or its removal), its reason, author and time; the earlier revision stays in history.

- **R30** (N433, K730; BOB's choice: own codes) This module's refusal of a progression the record has not declared, whether a condition (R2) or `declareAspiration` names it, is `INTENT_NO_SUCH_PROGRESSION` (C-111.4), of a required stage the progression does not declare `INTENT_BAD_STAGE` (C-111.6), and of a missing reason (R2, R8, R10, R18; R2 and R18 DEC-88, K1025) `INTENT_NO_REASON` (C-111.13; K766), each row's number and translation unchanged, so no code is held with two rows (DEC-49): it never answers `NO_SUCH_PROGRESSION`, `BAD_STAGE` or `NO_REASON`, which are `progressions`' (C-100.11, C-100.14, C-100.18).
**progress({project, viewer}) → `{ok, project, objective, condition, matched, meeting, short, undetermined, satisfied, computed_at}` or refusal**
- **R3** `NO_SUCH_PROJECT` as R2. With no condition, the answer carries `condition: null` and says progress cannot be computed because the objective states no condition; it never reads as zero.
- **R4** Otherwise, derived on read and never stored: the **matched** instances are the progression's instances whose entity is the condition's entity or stands in its `relation` to it (`entities`), passing `filter` (a flat map; the keys the record evaluates are `entity_kind`, the instance entity's kind, entities R5, and `amount`, R31; any other key, or a filter that is not a map, is kept and makes each matched instance undetermined with the reason that the record cannot evaluate it, never excluded; K198). An instance **meets** it when its grade (`progressions` R10) is at least `required.grade` and every stage in `required.stages` is placed. An instance missing a required stage is short, naming the stages missing, whatever its grade. An instance with every required stage placed whose grade is undetermined while the condition requires a grade, or whose `filter` the record cannot evaluate, is counted in `undetermined` with why, never as meeting or short; a condition with no required grade never asks the grade (K200). `satisfied` is true when `meeting / matched` reaches `share`, false when it cannot reach it even if every undetermined instance met it, else null. A condition says only what this shape holds (entity and relation, required grade and stages, share); a `filter` the record cannot evaluate on an instance makes it undetermined, never excluded, and an objective the shape cannot express keeps its text with progress stated as not computable (R3).
- **R31** (T33-58; ladders §8 F1, C3; K1471) A condition's `filter` may carry `amount: {min?, max?, currency, kinds?, phases?, period?}`. For a matched instance it is evaluated over the money facts `money.moneyOf` answers for the instance's entity in the named kinds, phases and period, compared in exact decimals (`calc-grammar`), never in floating point: the instance passes when the facts' total lies within the bounds, and fails when it lies outside. A total `money.summable` refuses (mixed kind, phase or stage, basis, currency or period; K1463), a fact whose amount or period is undetermined, or a `moneyOf` answer that is `truncated`, makes the instance undetermined with that reason, never excluded and never counted as zero (R4). The filter is a selection the member states; the total is never stored (R19) and is answered beside the instance with the facts it rests on.
- **R5** Each `short` instance names why: the stages missing, or the grade reached against the grade required and the weakest link (`progressions` R10). Bundle ids the viewer may not see are null; counts and grades are the same for every reader.

**gaps({project, viewer}) → `{ok, project, gaps}`**
- **R6** One gap per short instance: a missing stage names the progression, entity and stage (the records request already specified); a short grade names the link to strengthen. Each gap is a proposal (Interaction Constructs, PROPOSAL), offered to `queue` as kind `objective-gap` and to `scheduler` for ordering through R28.

**watchSet({project, after?, limit?}) → `{entities, progressions, captures, limit, truncated, cursor, measure_truncated}`**
- **R7** What the condition reads: its entity and related entities, its progression, and the captures placed in matched instances, so `monitoring` watches exactly those. Empty with no condition. `captures` is paged in capture order after `after`: `limit` defaults to 1,000 and is clamped to 1–1,000, and `cursor` names the last capture answered when more follow, else null, so `monitoring` can follow it (N181, K239).
- **Bounds (N181, K239).** Every collection these services answer is bounded and says so: `progress` and `gaps` answer `limit` and `truncated`, and past 1,000 matched instances `satisfied` is null with its reason; `aspirationsFor` answers `departures_limit` and `departures_truncated`; `pursuitOf` answers `goals_limit`, `goals_truncated` (200), `triaged_limit` and `triaged_truncated` (1,000); `proposals` answers `set_aside_limit` (200, newest first) and `set_aside_truncated`. Their internal reads are bounded the same way, and each bound bounds the walk itself, never only what it keeps (N305, K367, K391, N323): R28's context reads the first 1,000 aspirations in id order, of any scope and held or retired alike, and takes the held ones of group or project scope in force, and, of the first 1,000 projects in id order, those with a condition, and `serves` answers `context_truncated` when either is cut; `proposals` with no project named reads at most the first 1,000 projects the viewer may see, in id order (a project hidden from the viewer is skipped and never counted, so `projects_truncated` says nothing of it; DEC-36), and answers `projects_truncated` when cut (K391); `pursuitOf` reads at most 1,000 named capture requests, in the order the basis names them, and answers `requests_limit` and `requests_truncated`; `aspirationsFor` and `contacts` read at most the first 1,000 aspirations the viewer may see (R12, R13); `pursuitOf` reads at most the first 1,000 goals (R14, `goals_read_truncated`); the ageing reads take at most 1,000 questions at `surfaced` (R27).

**servesOf({addresses?, bundles?, requests?}) → `{ok, serves, truncated}`** (for `scheduler`'s rank, its R10; not an op)
- **R28** For each named subject (at most 1,000 in all; beyond that the first 1,000 in the order given, with `truncated: true`), `serves` holds `{kind, id, gaps, aspirations}`: `gaps` the keys (R6) of every open gap, in any project, the subject serves, and `aspirations` the ids of every `held` aspiration in force (R12) for the subject's project that it serves, member aspirations aside (they shape that member's queue only, §12.1). A bundle serves a gap when it is a document of the gap's short instance, and an aspiration when it is placed in an instance of a progression the aspiration names or concerns an entity it names; an address serves what the bundles captured from it serve; a request serves what its address and its `target` question serve. A subject serving nothing, or unknown, answers empty lists. It is read as the plane, orders work only and is never shown: no read of evidence uses it (R21). It writes nothing and never throws.

**Goals: declareGoal({statement, bounds, aspiration?, author}), linkObjective({goal, project, author}), closeGoal({goal, reason, author})**
- **R8** Each refuses a machine (`MACHINE_CANNOT_DECLARE_GOAL`), an empty statement or bounds (`PURSUIT_UNSTATED`, K238), a goal or aspiration the author may not see (`NO_SUCH_GOAL`, `NO_SUCH_ASPIRATION`), and `closeGoal` without a reason (`INTENT_NO_REASON`, R30). `linkObjective` records the decomposition as the author's dated claim and needs the author joined in that project. A goal carries no progress figure; its objectives do. A closed goal stays readable with its objectives and reason.

**Aspirations: declareAspiration({scope, owner, statement, entities?, progressions?, author}), departFrom({project, aspiration, reason, author}), recordDeadEnd({aspiration, note, author}), retireAspiration({aspiration, taught, author})**
- **R9** A machine is refused (`MACHINE_CANNOT_DECLARE_ASPIRATION`). A `member` aspiration is declared, revised or retired only by that member (`NOT_YOURS`); a `project` one by a member joined in the project; a `group` one only by an active administrator (the founder included), the act dated and attributed; anyone else is refused `NOT_AN_ADMIN` through `membership.notAnAdmin` (its R84; K102, N327), its `remedy` the next step C-111.16 gave: an active administrator declares, revises or retires it in their own name (K463). The group's and a member's aspirations are readable by every member; a project's by every member who may see the project (R23; K239). An aspiration declared with an empty statement is refused `PURSUIT_UNSTATED` (C-111.10, K238), as R8's goal is (DEC-88; K1025; `pursuits.test.mjs`:103).
- **R10** A project holds every `held` group aspiration unless it records a departure, which needs a reason (`INTENT_NO_REASON`, R30) and is answered as notable wherever the project's aspirations are read.
- **R11** `retireAspiration` requires a non-empty `taught` (`NO_LESSON`); a retired aspiration and its pursuit record stay readable. `recordDeadEnd` requires a non-empty `note`, the member's words on what was tried and why it went nowhere (`NO_NOTE`, C-111.27), and appends a dated, authored entry that is never removed (DEC-88; K1025; `pursuits.test.mjs`:153).

**aspirationsFor({project?, member?, viewer}), contacts({viewer}), pursuitOf({aspiration, viewer})**
- **R12** `aspirationsFor` answers those in force: the group's less any departure (each departure listed with its reason), the project's, and the member's, each with its scope. No precedence is stated or implied, and nothing is resolved between them. It reads at most the first 1,000 aspirations the viewer may see, in id order, held or retired and of any scope, each counted whether or not it is answered (a project aspiration of a project the viewer may not see is skipped and never counted: DEC-36, K391), answers those in force among them, and answers `limit` (1,000) and `truncated: true` when more follow.
- **R13** `contacts` lists each pair of held aspirations that name a common entity or progression, with what they share. It never says two aspirations contradict. It pairs the held aspirations among the aspirations R12's read takes (the first 1,000 the viewer may see, in id order, held or retired) and lists at most 1,000 pairs, in the order of their first and then second aspiration's id, answering `limit` (1,000) and `truncated: true` when either is cut.
- **R14** `pursuitOf` answers the goals and objectives opened under the aspiration, the proposals triaged under them with each act and reason, the capture requests named in them with their outcome, and the dead ends. It carries no completion figure. It finds the aspiration's goals by reading at most the first 1,000 goals held, in id order, whatever aspiration each names (a goal is readable by every member, R23, so the read and its cut hide nothing), and answers `goals_read_truncated: true` when more goals follow.

**The discovery loop: registerSource(kind, reader), proposals({project?, viewer}), triage({proposal, act, project?, reason?, author, viewer})**
- **R15** A later module registers a proposal source once at start (K31's pattern); `progressions.proposalsFeed` is read directly. `proposals` answers every open proposal from every source, each with its grade and basis; one check firing across many subjects is one proposal carrying its instances.
- **R16** `act` is `adopt` (into the named project's objective, recorded in the project's record with who and when), `question` (opens a question at `surfaced`, through `inquiry`, with the proposal as its basis), `defer` or `dismiss` (a reason required, `INTENT_NO_REASON`, R30; a progression proposal is decided through `progressions.disposeProposal`). A machine may `question` and is refused every other act (`MACHINE_CANNOT_TRIAGE`). A deferred or dismissed proposal stays readable with its reason.

**ageSurfaced(now) → `{aged}`** (called by `scheduler`)
- **R17** A question surfaced by a machine (`surfaced_by: agent`) that no member has acted on within the instance's ageing interval moves to `deferred` with the recorded reason "surfaced by an assistant; no member acted within N days", through `inquiry`'s dispose act under a plane actor. Nothing is deleted.

**ageDue(now), ageWake(now) → instant | null** (for `scheduler`, beside R17 as its tick)
- **R27** A question is **ageable** when R17 would move it (at `surfaced`, surfaced by a machine, no member's entry); its **ageing instant** is its last entry's time plus the ageing interval. `ageDue` answers the earliest ageing instant of any ageable question, past or not; `ageWake` the earliest one later than `now`; each answers null when there is none. A question R17 tried and could not move stays due and is tried again at a later firing, never woken for. Both write nothing and never throw. `ageDue`, `ageWake` and R17's `ageSurfaced` each read at most 1,000 questions at `surfaced`, those whose last entry is oldest first (then by id), and judge ageability among those alone; `ageSurfaced` answers `limit` (1,000) and `truncated: true` when more questions at `surfaced` follow. A question past the read is reached once earlier ones leave `surfaced` or take a newer entry.

**workObjective({project, reason, author}) → the run opened, or refusal**
- **R18** A member's act only (`MACHINE_CANNOT_CHOOSE_THE_QUESTION`, DEC-24 rule 2), then `INTENT_NO_REASON` (R30: the `reason`, the member's words on why the run is opened, absent, not a string or blank, as R8's; DEC-88 (4), K1025), with nothing opened: opens a run through `ai-runs` with the project as its context and the objective and its current gaps as its instructions. The run's looks name the project under authority kind `objective`. The reason is recorded on the run's opening and shown with its budget and scope (the run's `label`, K1068).

**The warning about a person in no public role, and a request answered that no record exists** (T41; N820; `draft-T41-investigation.md` §3.6; K2405, K2417, K2418; R32's warning and test are `inquiry` R59's)
- **R32** *(not yet met: T41)* (D13) The same warning, by the same test, at a promotion that states or revises a project's `objective` or condition (R1, R2) and at R16's `adopt`; never refused, her choice recorded.
- **R33** *(not yet met: T41)* (H30 (1)) An instance short of a required stage meets it when the record holds, for that stage, a records request answered that no such record exists (`actions`' outcome, as registered with `intent` by `registerSource`'s pattern), stated beside it as "answered: none exists"; met is still computed from the record (R4), never declared (H28).

## Private

### Uses

- `record-grammar`: the shared grammar names this module once read from the check catalogue (frontmatter, types, ids, actors, labels, grades, `SHARED_ACT_CHECKS`), re-pointed in T19 (rule 1); the catalogue rows it owned are in its own code (K808, K823).
- `record-core`: `recordOf(ctx)`, `transact`, id allocation for aspirations and goals, `declarePurge`.
- `membership`: `viewerPredicate`, `projectAuthority`, `isAdministrator`, `isProjectEditor`; `notAnAdmin` (its R84), R9's `NOT_AN_ADMIN` (N327); `noSuchProject` (its R78), through which R2's, R3's and every other act's `NO_SUCH_PROJECT` is answered, in place of C-111.2 (N208, K275).
- `promotion`: `promote`, `registerStep` (R1, R2). *(not declared)*
- `entities`: `readEntity`, the constitutive relations (R4, R7, R28). *(not declared)* `noSuchEntity` (its R36), R2's `NO_SUCH_ENTITY`, in place of C-111.5 (N285).
- `provenance`: the captures held at an address (R28). *(not declared)*
- `progressions`: `readProgression`, `readInstance`, `proposalsFeed`, `disposeProposal` (R4–R6, R15, R16).
- `retrieval`: `selectionCreate` (one enumerated selection per aged question, owner `plane:intent`, for inquiry's `dispose`; R17; K198).
- `capture-requests`: `requestById` (its R43: one request's outcome by key, for R14's pursuit; N291) and `bundlesOf` (its R28); `captureRequests` (a request's address, for R28's serving).
- `inquiry`: the create-at-`surfaced` path and the dispose act (R16, R17).
- `ai-runs`: opening a run (R18).
- `money` (T33-58): `moneyOf` and `summable` (R31); `calc-grammar`'s exact decimals, through `money`'s answer or directly (open: the job's COMPLETE states its final `uses`, K1505 (7)).
- `content`: nothing any requirement calls. Proposed dropped.

### Invariants

- **R19** Progress is derived, never reported: no service accepts a progress figure, count, share or completion, and nothing stores one (Framework §12 consequence 1; invariant 8).
- **R20** An assistant proposes at any point and adopts at none: every act that adopts, dismisses, defers, sets a condition, links, declares, departs, closes or retires refuses a machine (§12 "The discovery loop").
- **R21** Aspirations and goals set priority and never filter evidence: no read here or elsewhere is narrowed, reordered or withheld by one, and a proposal that cuts against a goal is offered on the same terms as one that supports it (Framework invariant 7, §12.2).
- **R22** C-2.9's objective arm, and C-2.9's `closed_reason` arm (R29), move here as invariants with their tests (K6); every refusal this file names gets a catalogue row in this module, except `NO_SUCH_PROJECT`, whose one row is membership's (its R78; N208, K275), `NO_SUCH_ENTITY`, whose one row is entities' (its R36; N285, K275), and `NOT_AN_ADMIN` and `PROJECT_ACT_NOT_A_PARTICIPANT`, whose rows are membership's (C-96.1, its R84; its R55; N327, K468).
- **R23** Every read and act naming a project, goal or aspiration the viewer may not see answers exactly as an absent one.
- **R24** This module's tables carry the id they are about and are declared to record-core's purge (K23).
- **R25** No place is named in this module's behaviour or outward text; §12's examples are illustrations only.
- **R26** Aspirations and goals are record documents of two new types, with history, the gate (`promotion`) and authored revisions like every other record object: an aspiration's states are `held → retired`, a goal's `open → closed`, and no other move is accepted; the pursuit record survives abandonment (§12.2).

### Satisfies

- `docs/architecture/BIO_Content_Framework_v0_10.md` §12 (the three things; not a new hierarchy; satisfaction conditions; the discovery loop and its rules; an assistant may open a focus unattended: aggregate, age), §12.1 (scopes, inheritance and departure, no precedence, contact), §12.2 (the pursuit record), §2 invariants 7 and 8.
- `docs/architecture/BIO_State_Rules_Consistency_v1_5.md` §4 (the project's `objective`, C-2.9).
- `docs/architecture/BIO_Interaction_Constructs_v0_1.md`, P · PROPOSAL (the gap list derived from an objective's satisfaction condition).
- `docs/architecture/BIO_Assistant_and_AI_Roles_v0_1.md` (DEC-24 rule 2: the objective is a member's; an objective going looking is authorised by the member).
- `docs/development/NOTIFICATIONS.md`, Analysis: `objective-gap` (D-76), the assistant-surfaced focus (D-78, D-82).
- `build/layers.md`, layer 7 (what monitoring, scheduling and publication take from intent).
- State Rules §4 gains the aspiration and goal types and their state machines (R26; K102, a change to the canon's text).

### Suggestions

- **Factory.** `intentOf(ctx)` answers the one instance per Durable Object storage (K61).
- **Focus and problem.** §12 names both; the record has one construct for both since REC-10, the inquiry, so R16's `question` opens an inquiry at `surfaced`. An obstacle reads as such in its question text.
- **Where the condition lives.** In the project document's frontmatter, beside `objective`, so it has the project's history and gate; R1's check gains the condition's grammar (R2's refusals) when it lands.
- **Ageing interval.** An instance setting in record-core (K23), default 30 days, the staleness age C-10.1 already uses.
- **Callers.** `monitoring` reads R7; `scheduler` reads R28 for ordering and calls R17 when R27 says it is due; `publication` reads R14 and R16's deferred and dismissed proposals to state what was set aside; `queue` renders R6.
- Tests: each refusal gets a negative control; R4 gets an arm where an undetermined instance keeps `satisfied` null; R21 gets an arm that declares an aspiration and shows a search and a proposal list byte-identical before and after.

- **The `amount` key's shape (R31; T33-58, BOB's technical detail).** The key's fields follow `money.moneyOf`'s filters; whether a total over several money facts or each fact alone is compared to the bounds is the job's START question (the draft takes the total, as F1's "how much of the fund's spending"). A fund as the scope (rather than the instance's entity) waits for a condition naming a fund.

## Open for Bob

None: answered by Bob 2026-09-26 (K102).

## Decided by BOB (for the rulings file)

- `intent`'s uses gain `promotion` and `entities` and drop `content`; `from` becomes `legacy-checks` (`build/extraction/intent.md` §3).
- §12's focus and problem both open an inquiry at `surfaced` (REC-10's single construct).
- The ageing interval is an instance setting, default 30 days.
- C-2.9's objective arm moves to `intent`; its other arms (`workproduct_state`, `evaluations`, `closed_reason`) and C-9.1 stay in `legacy-checks` for their owner.
