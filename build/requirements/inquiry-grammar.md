# inquiry-grammar — requirements

**Status** · In force: taken from `legacy-checks` for size (K617, K653), meaning unchanged: R1, R2 and R8 are `inquiry` R2, R3 and R38's share (each marked "was", retired there); R4 names the leg grammar `inquiry` R4–R9 state, which stay `inquiry`'s. Last changed T41 (T41-13: R18 new, `bias_applied` on a leg, as `draft-T41-investigation.md` §3.6; K2405, K2418), not yet met; every other requirement met (K1990).

**Size (P6).** About 1,400 lines moved and 60 written (`draft-T19.md`, layer 6). `inquiry` keeps about 3,700.

### Purpose

The grammar of an inquiry document as the record checks it: the entry requirements of each state and the division block (C-2.8), the leg grammar and its grounds, testimony, earned and inherited arms (C-2.8, C-6.3, C-21.2), a leg's part (C-45 through `content`), the supersession and division-disclosure arms of the references (C-6.1), the recheck coverage (C-15.1) and the lead checker every leg grammar consults (C-54.1). It also holds the rows `inquiry`'s acts mint for the inquiry's own refusals (C-33.13, C-33.22, C-33.23, C-32.7, C-32.8). It reads no record: every function is pure, and the facts a check needs (the published and earned registries) are handed to it.

### Provides

Terms. A **finding** is `record-grammar`'s (its R11): `{check, severity, message, repairs?, code?}`. **ctx** is `checkBundle`'s per-bundle context (record-grammar R39, R40): `fm` the parsed front matter, `files`, `publishedRegistry`, `earnedRegistry`. An **inquiry** is a document whose `object_type` normalises to `inquiry` (`normalizeType`, record-grammar).

**The entry arm: checkInquiryExtension(ctx, findings)** (record-grammar R28's `C-2.8` slot) Pure; never throws; pushes findings and answers nothing. For any document that is not an inquiry it pushes nothing.
- **R1** (was `inquiry` R2) Entry requirements (C-2.8): `surfaced_by` is `agent` or `human`; `deferred` and `dismissed` carry a non-empty `disposition_reason`; `concluded` carries a conclusion, at least one leg, and a falsifier accounted for: stated, or its absence recorded with both `falsifier_override_by` and `_at`, never both and never half (REC-117); `subject_entity`, when present, is an entity id; a finding's bytes name no case (CASE-5b).
- **R2** (was `inquiry` R3) `divided` requires a `division` block (a reason, `apportioned_by` a named member and not a machine, an ISO `at`, at least two distinct canonical children) and a `division_apportionment` giving every leg at least one home among those children, each child at least one leg, and each row's target equal to the leg's (C-2.8, R4 of Case Making).

**The recheck coverage: checkRecheckCoverage(ctx, findings)** (record-grammar R28's `C-15.1` slot) Pure; never throws.
- **R3** For an inquiry, in every state including `dismissed`: `recheck_triggers` absent, not a list, or empty is one `C-15.1` error; otherwise each trigger that is not an object carrying a non-empty `text` and a non-empty `description` is one `C-15.1` error naming its index, and each whose `date` is present and is not a calendar date in the form `YYYY-MM-DD` (`civil-time`'s calendar validation: `2026-02-31` and `2026-13-01` are errors; §7 item 6) is one `C-15.1` error naming its index and the value. Any other document: nothing.

**The leg grammar: checkInquiryBasis(fm, findings, publishedRegistry, earnedRegistry), checkLegExtentGrammar(leg, label, checkId, findings), supersedesEdgeFindings(fm, findings), divisionDisclosureFindings(fm, findings), GROUND_LABEL_RE, EARNED_SOURCE_AXIS** Pure; never throw; each finding names its check.
- **R4** These judge exactly what `inquiry` R4–R9 state (the leg's target, vocabularies and grades, C-6.3, C-54.1 and the theme first; the leg's part; the earned and testimony arms; the inherited arm, C-21.2; the grounds, DEC-32; the supersession and division-disclosure arms, C-6.1), each finding the same in check, severity, message, repairs and code as the catalogue's before the move. `inquiry`'s grammar face re-exports each name, the same binding (`===`), so `inquiry` R4–R9 are met through it. `checkInquiryBasis` no longer calls `basisVersionFindings`: the version block is `basis-versions`' own grammar (its R43), run at R6's sub-slot where the call stood. `checkInquiryExtension` (R1, R2) calls `checkInquiryBasis` with `ctx`'s two registries, as today.

**The lead checker: leadLegFindings(label, leg, findings), LEAD_CHECKS** (C-54.1) Pure; never throws.
- **R5** A leg (any value; a non-object is read as an empty leg) whose `target` or `content_id`, trimmed, is a lead id (`observation-log`'s `LEAD_ID_RE`) gains one `C-54.1` error, code `LEAD_NOT_EVIDENCE`, naming `label`, the field and the value, the first such field only, and the answer is `true`; otherwise nothing is pushed and the answer is `false`. It is the one checker every leg grammar consults (this module's basis, `basis-versions`' version legs, the action basis), each skipping its own target complaint about a leg it answered `true` for. `LEAD_CHECKS.LEAD_NOT_EVIDENCE` is the row, `{check, where, translation}`, its number and translation unchanged.

**The imported finding reference: IMPORTED_FINDING_RE, importedFindingRef(import, finding), parseImportedFindingRef(s)** (DEC-112 (6); DEC-96 items 1, 4; N522) Pure; never throws.
- **R11** **The imported finding reference.**
  - `IMPORTED_FINDING_RE` matches exactly `imported:<import>/<finding>`. `<import>` is `case-import`'s import id (64 lowercase hex). `<finding>` is the finding's id as the source case states it (`BUNDLE_ID_RE`). The two never collide with a local id, which `BUNDLE_ID_RE` alone matches.
  - `importedFindingRef(import, finding)` spells it, or answers null when the parts would not spell a ref this pattern matches. `parseImportedFindingRef(s)` answers `{import, finding}`, or null.
  - `importedLegFindings(label, leg, findings, checkId = "C-21.3")`: the leg arm below, answering whether the leg's target is a ref, pushing one finding per departure into `findings` (K1304). For such a leg the grade-vocabulary, axis and source, hunch, testimony, earned, inherited and extent arms stay silent; each field they judge is already one departure here.

  **The leg on it.** A leg whose `target` is such a ref:
  - names a positive integer `target_edition`;
  - carries no `grade`, `grade_axis` or `grade_source` (the edition's grades stand as published: DEC-96 item 1);
  - carries no `content_id`, extent or `extent_capture`;
  - is not listed in `references[]`, so C-6.3 does not ask it, and a `references[]` entry naming a ref is refused.

  Any departure is one `C-21.3` error, `IMPORTED_LEG_MALFORMED`, naming the leg and the field. Whether an acceptance is in force is not asked here (`accepted-work` R3, R4). The arm is pure and never throws. `checkInquiryBasis` runs it in place of R4's target arm for such a leg; every other arm of R4 (lead and theme first, role, grounds) is unchanged. (DEC-112 (6); DEC-96 items 1, 4; K1273)

**T33: ids, and the new leg targets** (T33-43; K1447 (i)–(iii); Choices 16)
- **R12** (S0-4; B0.3) `ENTITY_ID_RE` is `record-grammar`'s `idPattern("ENT")` (`ID_TABLE`), so R1's `subject_entity` accepts `ENT-2026-10000` and refuses `ENT-2026-999`; no copy of the pattern is held here.
- **R13** (K1447 (iii)) The leg arm (R4) admits a held standard as a leg's target: a `STD-` id listed in `references[]` like an information target, optionally with `target_portion`, a string naming a portion path (`standards` R18), its form judged by `standards.isPortionPath` (its R31), imported and never spelled here (N583; K1608); whether the standard holds that portion is `inquiry`'s check, since this module reads no record (R9). Its grade is on the capture axis only, its source `capture`, bounded by what the standard's captured text earns (`leg-earning` R8, through the earned registry handed in: an undetermined ceiling refuses any capture grade, R6's rule); a `connection` or `testimony` axis on it, or a `hunch` source, is one C-2.8 error naming the leg. Every other arm of R4 (lead and theme first, role, grounds, extent) reads it as an information leg.
- **R14** (C:A-7; K1447 (ii)) The `calculation` leg kind: a leg whose target is a `CALC-` id (`record-grammar`'s `ID_TABLE`; `OBJECT_TYPES` `calculation`). A `CALC-` id names a row, not a bundle (R3), so such a leg is not listed in `references[]`, as R15's and R11's are not (K1601). It carries no `grade`, `grade_axis` or `grade_source`: its grades are derived from its inputs (`strength`, K1447 (ii): the weakest input capture, each capped by its derivation; recipe arithmetic never a weakening step), and carries no `content_id` or extent. `CALCULATION_REF_RE` matches exactly the id; `calculationLegFindings(label, leg, findings)` pushes one C-2.8 error per departure, naming the field, and answers whether the target is a calculation.
- **R15** (K1447 (i); Choices 16) The duty-occurrence leg kind: a leg whose target is `occurrence:<DUT id>/<key>`, `<key>` the occurrence's key as `duties` derives it (its R9), its form judged by `duties.OCCURRENCE_KEY_RE` (its R24): imported from a duties file that imports nothing of the record once duties offers one (N675); until then held here, and a test asserts it equal to duties' export, so the two cannot drift and the case checker does not bundle the store (N583; K1608, K1799): a `<key>` it does not match spells no ref (`occurrenceRef` answers null, `parseOccurrenceRef` null). `OCCURRENCE_REF_RE`, `occurrenceRef(duty, key)` (null when the parts would not spell one) and `parseOccurrenceRef(s)` (`{duty, key}` or null) are pure. Such a leg is not listed in `references[]`, carries no `grade`, `grade_axis` or `grade_source` (its derivation, the source in force, trigger date, due date and level searched, is `leg-earning` R9's and its grade `strength`'s) and no `content_id` or extent. `occurrenceLegFindings(label, leg, findings)` pushes one C-2.8 error per departure and answers whether the target is a ref; `checkInquiryBasis` runs it, and R14's arm, in place of R4's target arm for such a leg, as R11 does for an imported finding. Whether the occurrence exists is not asked here (it is `inquiry`'s check, reading `duties`). An action is never a leg target (D113).
- **R17** (N582; K1607) The derived-connection leg kind: a leg whose target is a derived connection's id, 64 lowercase hexadecimal digits (`connection-grammar.derivedId`, its R11), carrying the derivation it was formed from as five flat fields, `derivation_kind`, `derivation_from`, `derivation_to`, `derivation_as_of` and `derivation_method` (a document's list items hold scalars only), each a non-empty string. Such a leg is admitted, no longer refused as an unknown target. Like R14's and R15's derived kinds it is not listed in `references[]` (it names a connection, not a bundle), and carries no `grade`, `grade_axis` or `grade_source` (its grade is its chain's, `connection-grammar` R12) and no `content_id` or extent. `derivedConnectionLegFindings(label, leg, findings)` pushes one C-2.8 error per departure, naming the field: a missing or empty `derivation_*` field, a target not equal to `derivedId` of the five, a grade field, a content id or an extent; it answers whether the target is a derived connection id (64 lowercase hex). `checkInquiryBasis` runs it in place of R4's target arm for such a leg, as for R14 and R15; every other arm of R4 (lead and theme first, role, grounds) is unchanged. Whether the connection re-derives, and whether its chain carries a declared or hunch hop, is not asked here: it is `hypotheses` R6's store-side check (through `explore.rederive`, its R19), since this module reads no record (R9).
- **R18** *(not yet met: T41)* (D59) A leg may carry `bias_applied: [{statement, effect, from?, to?}]`, `statement` a bias statement id (`BIA-`, its form checked here; whether it is in force for the inquiry's project lens, `bias` R49, is checked store-side by `inquiry` R61, since this module reads no record, R9; K2448, K2472) and `effect` one of `grade_lowered` (with `from` and `to`), `leg_excluded`, `inference_refused`; malformed is `BIAS_APPLICATION_MALFORMED` inside `BASIS_REFUSED`. It moves no grade by itself: the leg's stated grade is the member's.

**The registration** (rule 2; record-core R67; record-grammar R28, R40)
- **R6** At start, the module registers through record-core's grammar seam (`registerGrammar`, record-core R67) the arms of record-grammar R28's three slots it takes: `checkSupersession` (`C-6.1`: `supersedesEdgeFindings` then `divisionDisclosureFindings` over `ctx.fm`, for every document, at the end of the references arm), `checkRecheckCoverage` (`C-15.1`, R3) and `checkInquiryExtension` (`C-2.8`, R1, R2, R4), each slot claimed whole, in one registration (record-core R67, K766). Today the catalogue's C-2.8 arm runs `basisVersionFindings` inside itself, for an inquiry only, after the entry, division and subject-entity findings (R1, R2) and before the grounds and leg findings (R4); so the arm offers a sub-slot at exactly that place, and `basis-versions`' grammar, registered into the C-2.8 slot after this module's (its R43), runs there, never after the arm (P1). From then the catalogue's `LEGACY_GRAMMARS` fills neither `C-6.1` nor `C-15.1`, and the catalogue's own C-2.8 arm is gone. For every bundle, `checkBundle` called with `record.grammars()` answers the findings it answered before the move, identical in content and in order.

**The rows: INQUIRY_GRAMMAR_CHECKS** (DEC-49; K6)
- **R7** The module holds, each `{check, where, translation}` with its number and translation unchanged and its `where` naming the site that now raises it: `NOT_INQUIRIES` (C-33.13), `SELF_BASIS` (C-33.22), `BASIS_CYCLE` (C-33.23), `MACHINE_CANNOT_DIVIDE` (C-32.7), `MACHINE_CANNOT_GROUND` (C-32.8), and `LEAD_NOT_EVIDENCE` (C-54.1, R5), and a new row, `IMPORTED_LEG_MALFORMED` (C-21.3, R11; N522), its translation BOB's draft: "A leg on another group's finding names that finding and one edition, and nothing else: its grades are that edition's. Correct the leg. Nothing was written." `inquiry` mints the first five in its acts (its R20, R11, R23, R27) and reads them from here. A changed `where` was stamped by 1.50.0.

### Uses

- `record-grammar`: `normalizeType`, `parseFrontmatter`, the finding shape, `BUNDLE_ID_RE`, `BASIS_ROLES`, `BASIS_GRADES`, `GRADE_AXES`, `GRADE_SOURCES`, `EARNED_CAPTURE_CEILING`, `TESTIMONY_GRADE`, `isMachineIdentity`, `ISO_TS_RE`, as T19's layer 1 moved them.
- `record-grammar`: the shared grammar names this module once read from the check catalogue (frontmatter, types, ids, actors, labels, grades, `SHARED_ACT_CHECKS`), re-pointed in T19 (rule 1); the catalogue rows it owned are in its own code (K808, K820).
- `text-chain`: the extent functions the leg's part is read through.
- `content`: `checkContentExtent` and its document-only context (C-45).
- `connections`: `themeLegFindings` (C-81.1), asked of each leg before any other complaint about it.
- `observation-log`: `LEAD_ID_RE` (R5).
- `civil-time`: calendar-date validation (R3; T33-43).
- `standards`: the `STD-` id form and `isPortionPath` (its R31) only (R13); nothing here reads a standard (T33-43; N583).
- `duties`: `OCCURRENCE_KEY_RE` (its R24) only (R15); nothing here reads a duty (N583).
- `connection-grammar`: `derivedId` (its R11) only (R17; N582).
- `record-grammar`: also `idPattern`, `ID_TABLE`, `OBJECT_TYPES` (R12, R14; T33-43).
- `record-core`: `registerGrammar` (its R67) for R6, and nothing else: no read or write of the record.

### Invariants

- **R8** (was `inquiry` R38's share) Each check moves here as an invariant with its test (K6): C-2.8 and C-21.2 as the grammar uses them, C-6.1's supersession and division arms, C-6.3, C-15.1, C-54.1, and the rows C-33.13, C-33.22, C-33.23, C-32.7, C-32.8, and C-21.3 (R11; N522). Promotion stamps them.
- **R9** Pure: apart from R6's registration, nothing here reads or writes the record, the clock or the network; the same inputs give the same findings.
- **R10** No place is named in this module's behaviour or outward text.
- **R16** (DEC-49) The departures of R13–R15 and R17 are C-2.8 findings, each with its code: `STANDARD_LEG_AXIS` (R13), `CALCULATION_LEG_MALFORMED` (R14), `OCCURRENCE_LEG_MALFORMED` (R15), `DERIVED_LEG_MALFORMED` (R17; N582), held in `INQUIRY_GRAMMAR_CHECKS` with their translations, stamped by promotion's next stamping. Every other finding of R1–R11 is unchanged in check, severity, message, repairs and code for a document holding no new leg kind.

### Satisfies

- `docs/architecture/BIO_System_Design.md` §3, construct 8.
- `docs/architecture/BIO_Case_Making_v0_1.md`: the collapse, division 1–5, R1 (DEC-18), R2 (DEC-21), R4.
- `docs/architecture/BIO_State_Rules_Consistency_v1_5.md` §4 and its amendments.
- `docs/development/MEMBER-KNOWLEDGE-DESIGN.md` §3 (testimony grade), §5 (a lead is not evidence).
- DEC-12, DEC-15, DEC-18, DEC-21, DEC-32, REC-16, REC-117, CASE-5b.
- DEC-112 (6)'s last clause and DEC-96 items 1 and 4 (R11; N522, K1273).

### Suggestions

- **The move.** The job moves the names above from the catalogue, registers them (R6) and re-points `inquiry/grammar.mjs` to this module and record-grammar's `checkBundle`; the catalogue's copies go once every importer reads this module (rule 1). The catalogue's own grammars still call some of these names until their owners move them (`basisVersionFindings` until `basis-versions` in this layer; `actionBasisFindings` until `action-grammar`, layer 9), so a name they call stays in the catalogue until then.
- **T33 (T33-43).** R14 and R15 refuse a stated grade on the two derived kinds, as R11 does for an imported finding; a member's grade on such a leg would claim what the record derives (K1447 (i), (ii)). This is the fold's reading, named to BOB. The occurrence ref's spelling (`occurrence:<DUT id>/<key>`) is this fold's, on R11's pattern. The new rows' translations are the job's to draft (the design stream words them for members).
- Tests: for a corpus of inquiry, information and project documents, `checkBundle` with the registration answers findings byte-identical, in order, to the catalogue's before the move (K585 (2), K640); each of R1–R5 gets a negative control; R6's registration is answered `{ok: true}` by record-core.
