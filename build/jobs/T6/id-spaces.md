# Job record: id-spaces, T6

**Status** · WAITING ON BOB for Q1 (R26's retirement in the requirements); every entry applied, every test and every other check passing. ID-SPACES #2, session `session_01DAomLCBqmFvF1k6WfbWamt`, depth 2, branch `job/T6/id-spaces` (cut from `tranche/T6` @ 039eb27c33). Process: civicos-process, `roles/JOB.md`. Entry: N105.

**Read whole:** `roles/JOB.md`; `PROCESS-MECHANICS.md`; `build/manifest.md`; `build/requirements/id-spaces.md`; the public part of `jurisdictions`; `build/layers.md` (layer 1's contract, "No jurisdiction in the product"); `bio-plane/src/idspaces.mjs`; `bio-plane/test/m/id-spaces/` (all three files); my entry and N105's text in `build/plan/current.md`; K35. To confirm nothing still calls the old names: every importer of `idspaces.mjs` (`entities/index.mjs`, `test/rec203-idspaces.test.mjs`, `test/nc-rec203.mjs`) and every use of `ID_SPACES`, `CMS_FLOOR`, `apnStanding`, `systemOfAddresses` in the repository (only `jurisdictions/test/helpers.mjs`, which holds its own snapshot copy as an oracle).

## Questions to BOB

- **Q1 · R26 is retired by N105, but the requirements still list it live.** N105 retires R26 (K35), and the adapter it describes is gone, so no test can check it; the coverage check now fails on it (`1 of 26 live ids named by no test: R26`). Marking an id retired is BOB's (`build/requirements/id-spaces.md`). **Best reading:** BOB marks R26 `*(retired: N105, K143)*` on its line (and the "Legacy adapter" heading with it) on `tranche/T6`; I then merge `tranche/T6`, re-run the checks and send `COMPLETE`. Nothing else in the job waits on it.

## Entries applied

- **N105** · the legacy adapter at the foot of `idspaces.mjs` removed: `ID_SPACES`, `CMS_FLOOR`, `apnStanding`, `systemOfAddresses`, `LEGACY_VIEW`, the old space-name maps, and the two old-call-shape branches in `recognise` and `judgePair`. The module's import of `jurisdictions` (`list`, `combine`), which only the adapter used, is gone: the module now imports nothing, which is R23 and R24 at their plainest (it cannot reach a held profile). Its test `legacy.test.mjs` is deleted. The header comment says R26 is retired.
- **A test in its place** (in R24's test): the module exports exactly its six view-first services, an old-shape `recognise("cms", …)` meets no view and answers `null`, and an old-shape `judgePair("project", a, b)` is refused with `TypeError`, never answered from a built-in view.

## Deferred

- None.

## Reports (other modules)

- **R1 · the plane bundle is stale** (`bio-plane/dist/bio-plane.bundled.mjs`, `not_product`; manifest §14): `fleetbundles.test.mjs` reports `STALE BUNDLE — the source src/idspaces.mjs has changed`. Expected; regenerate at the layer close (`bio-plane/`: `npm run build`).
- **R2 · legacy-tests, two stale comments:** `bio-plane/test/nc-rec203.mjs` line 16 says `judgePair` is the one "which the old interface's adapter calls", and `rec203-idspaces.test.mjs` line 56 describes the adapter; both are prose only (the suite and its arms pass: baseline 46/0, independence 45/1, formjoin 43/3 as designed). For `next.md`.
- **R3 · `jurisdictions/test/helpers.mjs`** keeps a snapshot copy of the old `idspaces.mjs` as an oracle for the first profile's facts (its own test, not an import); unaffected.
