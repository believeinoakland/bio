# T4 · capture — job record

**Session** CAPTURE #1, `session_0151qXkKcpqs1Km6yrLbXgtp`, on `job/T4/capture` (from `tranche/T4` @ `0446ab092b`; `tranche/T4` merged again after host-governor's early merge). Process: civicos-process `roles/JOB.md`, mechanics §6, §12.2, §13, §16. BOB: read from the Status line of `build/plan/current.md` on `origin/tranche/T4`.

**Status** · IN PROGRESS, 2026-09-27. The store half, the doorbell, the acquisition service and the op handlers are extracted and tested (59 tests, all green); the four checks pass. **Waiting on provenance's early merge** (K120 (1)) for the last step: forwarding `op=acquire` to the service, the drain's in-process arm, and removing the acquire handler's legacy code (below, "Open").

**Read whole:** `roles/JOB.md`, PROCESS-MECHANICS §6, §12–§16, `build/manifest.md`, `build/requirements/capture.md`, `build/extraction/capture.md`, `build/layers.md`, my entries in `build/plan/current.md`, rulings K3, K47–K49, K58, K60, K61, K66, K67, K72, K90, K91, K98, K99, K103, K119–K122; the public parts of every module in my Uses (jurisdictions, subresources, format-registry, docprofile, record-core, membership, host-governor, provenance, capture-sources); `bio-plane/src/record-core/index.mjs`, `bio-plane/src/host-governor/index.mjs`; the membership factory and op table; the legacy code my map names, measured again on `tranche/T4` @ `0446ab092b` (below); the snapshot's built work for D-340, D-701, D-702 and D-698.

## The legacy ranges, measured again (`0446ab092b`)

- `store.mjs` (49,817 lines): `knock`…`inboxResolve`, `Store.#sha256` 35906–36014; the render allowance 36041–36203 (`recordRuntimeObservation` and `runtimeObservations` stay, instance-setup's); `recordLinks`, `linksTo`, `resolveLinks` 40989–41143 (`projectLinks` stays, connections'); `recordLinkVerdict` 41200–41212; capture sessions 41214–41255; `siteAssets`, `recordSiteAssets`, `reusedParts` 45914–46070; `recordReuseVerdicts`, `reuseVerdicts`, `siteChrome`, `captureLimit`, `recordCaptureLimit` 46216–46374 (the monitor methods between stay); the D-98 header and `taskEnqueue` 46376–46423; the D-104 header, `FALLBACK_*` and `#thresholds` 46974–47028; `recordSourceOutcome`, `sourceReachability` 47702–47820; `TASK_KINDS` 692, `SOURCE_OUTCOMES` 807, `boundedSubject` 842; dispatch rows 48571–49800.
- `schema.mjs` (3,964 lines): `inbox` … `link_verdicts` 157–359; `task_queue` 446–475; `source_reachability` 513–545; `reuse_verdicts` 547–587; `render_allowance`, `render_slots` 3744–3782.
- `index.mjs` (13,438 lines): `userAgent` 163–203; `archiveSelect` 214–269; `KNOCK`…`knockEmpty` 2851–2944; `fingerprint` 2954–2958 (stays: `bootstrap` reads it); `PROFILE_TEXT_MAX`…`substanceDigests` 2969–3042; `captureRequestArm` 3963–4025; op `knock` 6744–6828; ops `links`, `capture` 7552–7606; `archivelookup` 7944–7982; `acquire` 7984–10153, of which the reading block 9225–9928 stays for `extraction` (K49, K72 (8)).

## What the module is (`bio-plane/src/capture/`, 9 files)

- `schema.mjs`: the thirteen tables moved verbatim from `schema.mjs`, the derived chrome tables (`site_chrome`, `site_chrome_refs`, `link_chrome`), `knock_key` (R56), the additive columns and the `links` reshape moved from the store's constructor, and the purge lists (eleven cleared whole-store, six exempt).
- `index.mjs`: `captureOf(ctx, opts)` (K61; reaches `recordOf(ctx)` and `governorOf(ctx)`, provenance injected until its merge), the store-side services R8, R15, R22–R29, R31, R32, R39, R40, R43–R46, R54, R56, the listeners (`on`, R44, R55), and `captureOps`, the Durable Object routes the store's dispatcher spreads in.
- `doorbell.mjs`: `KNOCK`, its published sentences, the three pre-store refusals and `knockOp`, the op's handler (R30, R47–R53).
- `acquire.mjs`: the acquisition act as a service in the Durable Object (K72 (11)), `archiveLookup`, `userAgent`, `profilesAsText`, `substanceDigests`, `profileView`, and `readingInputs` (what the op's reading block needs, K72 (8)).
- `ops.mjs`: the op handlers `linksOp`, `captureObjectOp`, `archiveLookupOp`, `acquireOp`, `withReading`.

The legacy store keeps its public capture methods as one-line delegations (old tests reach them over RPC), registers the scheduler's arming, the observation log's rows and the runtime measurement as listeners (R44, R55; K72 (9)), runs `captureOf(ctx).migrate()` after the schema pass, spreads `captureOps`, and filters capture's tables out of its purge declaration by `captureOwns` (its own list lines unchanged).

## Entries applied

- **T4-4** · extracted as above. The store half and the doorbell are live through the store's routes; `op=knock`, `op=links`, `op=capture` and `op=archivelookup` are the module's handlers. `op=acquire` still runs the legacy handler until provenance merges (Open).
- **D-701 (K76)** · `op=links` and the per-host navigation read answer through the caller's viewer (the control plane's stamp; membership R43's predicate over the register's bundle): a hidden source answers as not held, a hidden target capture is filtered before the bracket, and every count is taken after the filter. The per-host read is served as `op=links&host=<host>` rather than a new op, so the control plane's op table gains no row.
- **R17 (N3, N10)** · the profile is judged under the combined view of record-core's `jurisdiction_profiles` (`jurisdictions.combine`); an instance that never set the setting passes no view (docprofile's own K39 fallback), and `profile.jurisdiction_view` names what was used.
- **R18 (D-698)** · the direct letter is `EARNED_CAPTURE_CEILING`, the archive letter provenance's `ARCHIVE_CAPTURE_GRADE`; no letter is typed. D-698's built work (a definition in the catalogue) is not taken: R25 of provenance makes provenance the one definition.
- **R20 (K60)** · every capture calls `provenance.attest` with `archive: true` (not on the archive arm, whose locator is itself a replay) and records every attempt; a failure is an attempt, never a failed capture.
- **R28–R29 (D-340, D-702)** · built work judged and kept, adapted: a link filed with `chrome` (containment, with its basis) is the site's chrome only when it recurred on two or more distinct pages of the host, else `undetermined`, recorded with its basis and date in `link_chrome` and judged again at each observation; `site_chrome`/`site_chrome_refs` fingerprint each host's navigation; `deriveSiteChrome` regenerates a host by scan, paged; `navChanges` names what the navigation lost, one-page links apart as undetermined. The subresources half of D-340 (`furnitureLinks`) is subresources' code: REPORT 1.
- **R11, R42 (K49)** · a continuation reads the session's primary back by its digest and never fetches it; it answers `continued` and no `document` (a continuation files nothing new). The service answers no reading; `readingInputs` hands the op's reading block the stored primary and the same profile context.
- **R41 (K48, K119)** · a render asks `renderLocaleFor(view)` (capture-sources R54).
- **K98, K99** · the doorbell: R47–R53 tested; **R54** the bytes are stored before the row and the row lands in one transaction that asks the rate again (a knock refused there removes its own object unless another row names it); **R55** the compute measurement goes to `compute` listeners and `snapshot.compute_recorded` is gone; **R56** HMAC-SHA-256 under `KNOCK_FINGERPRINT_KEY` or a key generated once in `knock_key` (K120 (4)).
- **R45, R46 (N64)** · `taskEvents`, `taskEventCount`, `taskEventAttempt`, `taskEventRemove`, `liveCaptureSessions` provided.
- **K120 (3)** · R8's figures are record-core settings (`reachability_consecutive_failures`, `reachability_stale_days`, `reachability_min_failures_for_age`), R19's stagger `subresource_stagger_ms`; not set, the defaults.

## Found in my module and fixed

- **R9:** parts were cut wherever the stream's chunks fell, so one large chunk made a part over 8 MiB. Parts are now exactly 8 MiB, the last the remainder (C-18.6 reads the parts the document names, so nothing downstream moves).
- A fresh store's `links` lacked `chrome_basis` (the additive pass runs before the table exists); the column is in the DDL.

## Open (waiting on provenance's early merge, K120 (1))

1. `op=acquire` forwards to the service (`acquireOp` → the reading block → `withReading`), the drain's `#fireCaptureRequest` calls `captureOf(ctx).acquire(…, {captureRequest})` in process (K58), and the legacy acquire handler, `archiveSelect`, `userAgent`, `captureRequestArm`, `profilesAsText` and `substanceDigests` leave `index.mjs` (op=monitor then imports the last two, and `userAgent`, from capture). Until then the live `op=acquire` is the legacy handler, reaching the moved store services through the same routes.
2. The legacy store then passes `provenanceOf(ctx)` to `captureOf`; R12, R10's register question, R18's archive letter and R20's `attest` go live with it.

## Found in other modules (REPORT)

1. **subresources:** R28 needs each link's containment in a chrome region; `captureSubresources`' link records carry none (the snapshot's D-340 built it as `furnitureLinks` in `subresources.mjs`). Until subresources gives links `chrome` and `chrome_basis`, a live capture files every link as not contained, and R28/R29 classify only what callers file with containment.
2. **affordances:** acquire's answer carries `note: ACQUIRE_GRADE_NOTE`, composed in `affordances.mjs` (layer 11), which capture may not import. The op handler adds it. Suggest moving `acquireGradeNote` to `legacy-checks` beside the constants it composes, or to capture.
3. **legacy-tests (T4-5):** `doorbell.test` arm "the pin uses the plane's own knock window" reads `KNOCK.windowMs` out of `index.mjs`'s text (now `capture/doorbell.mjs`); `hygiene`'s schema census of the five exempt tables and the purge census; the source anchors the map's §5 lists; tests that set `FALLBACK_*` or `GOVERNOR_SUBRESOURCE_STAGGER_MS` as bindings now set the record-core settings (K120); `subresources.test` 1144–1177 (`recordruntime` and `compute_recorded`). Measured list below.
4. **Generated artifact:** `bio-plane/dist/bio-plane.bundled.mjs` is stale (new files under `src/capture/`, and `store.mjs`, `index.mjs`, `schema.mjs`).
   Measured on this branch @ the commit that adds this line (acquire still the legacy handler): `reachability` 40/0, `cap13-reuse-pages` 22/0, `subresources` 359/0, `reuse-ratify` 36/0, `cap14-reused-from` 23/0, `d260-resume` 22/0, `purge` 14/0, `rec174-supplyfetch` 23/0, `d522-unattended-render` 20/0, `archive-monitoring` 22/0, `empty-body` 10/0, `pipeline-e2e` 53/0, `rendered-capture` 103/0; red, each a source anchor: `doorbell` 71/1 (the window pin above), `hygiene` 1310/1 (its purge census does not know `site_chrome`, `site_chrome_refs`, `link_chrome`, `knock_key`, which capture declares), `observation-log` 130/1 (A2) and `capturerequests` 136/1, both "declared BEFORE the host_governor block", which host-governor's move made unanswerable (K72 (3)), not mine.
5. **capture's requirements (BOB's):** D-701's viewer filter is not stated in R27; suggested wording: "Every row passes the caller's viewer (membership R43, through the register's bundle) before it is listed or counted; a capture filed in no bundle is visible." The not-yet-met notes of R11, R17, R18, R28, R29, R41, R42, R45, R46, R54, R55, R56 can go when this job completes; R20's and R12's when provenance is wired.
6. **R32's fence:** "only a signed-in member lists, reads and resolves" is the control plane's (`SESSION_OPS`), not testable at capture's interface; R32's test checks the inbox's own behaviour.

## Questions

**QUESTION 1** (sent 2026-09-27 ~02:19; ANSWERED by K120): (1) providers injected until their merges, their names adopted on the CHANGE — host-governor's adopted (`governorOf`, `governedFetch`, `retryAfterMs`); (2) `odf-reader` is a use; (3) R8's figures are record-core settings, not bindings (applied); (4) R56's key as I read it.
