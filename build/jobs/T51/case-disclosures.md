QUESTION (my best reading is below; I carry on with it).

R33 (`dated` on `photosOf`) needs two services case-disclosures does not yet declare, and two tests need two more for K3268's "assemble a hand-list from the other module's own declaration". `checks/architecture.mjs` fails on exactly these four, nothing else:

1. `civil-time` (src): `localDay(instant, zone)` for the local day of the attesting capture's instant (`capture_actors.at`, read through `capture.captureAccountsOf`, the same first actor that gives `taken_by`).
2. `retrieval` (src): `zone()` (its R69), the team's governing time zone, the same read `ratification` R44 and `publish-schedule` R1 use. Reached lazily as `caseDisclosuresOf` reaches its others; a test passes its own.
3. `image-cover` (tests only): `COVER_REFUSALS`, so photos.test.mjs builds its refusal-code list from the module's table, not by hand.
4. `doc-clean` (tests only): `CLEAN_REFUSALS`, so documents.test.mjs does the same.

Please add `civil-time`, `retrieval`, `image-cover`, `doc-clean` to case-disclosures' `uses` in `build/modules.json` (and the requirements' Uses lines if you keep them in step). Until then my architecture check shows these 4 failures; they are the only ones.

Also for your record: the design stream's word row `case-disclosures.document_case_findings` says "acknowledgment"; the code's signed sentence says "acknowledgement" (case document byte-pinned by seam.test's hashes, K1333). I kept the code's spelling (a signed text changes only as a new version) and read it through `localize`; if you want the design's spelling, that is a new case-document version, your call.
