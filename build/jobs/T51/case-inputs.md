## J1 · QUESTION

R17 wording: "your group's Civicsmith" in the requirement and test title, "Your team's Civicsmith" in the words.

`build/requirements/case-inputs.md` R17 says the unread sentence names "your group's Civicsmith" (DEC-198 (7)). The test title at `bio-plane/test/m/case-inputs/openrequests.test.mjs`:150 says the same. The sentence the screen shows is `signing.openrequest.unread` in `docs/development/ux-substrate/screens/words.json`, which reads "Your team's Civicsmith couldn't read whether any request for comment on this case is still open, so none is listed here." The module reads it by key, and the test asserts the words.json text, so the test passes.

Best reading I am taking: the words file governs the sentence, since R10 and R17 say the words are read by key and never copied. The requirement's quoted phrase is a gloss on it.

Options:
(a) Keep "Your team's" in words.json; amend R17's quoted phrase and the test title to match. No behaviour change.
(b) Change words.json to "your group's" to match the requirement. That is a UX word, so it is your call, and it moves the words' stamp.

Recommendation: (a). I change nothing in code or words either way, and I will not touch the test title unless you pick (a) or (b).
