/* Read a `wrangler.jsonc` — JSON with comments — without corrupting its strings.
 *
 * ONE COPY, because two tools now read the same configs for the same reason:
 * `deploy-fleet.mjs` derives a member's bindings to deploy it, and
 * `release-assemble.mjs` derives the same bindings to SIGN them. If those two
 * parsed differently, a release would be signed describing one binding set and
 * deployed with another, and the disagreement would surface as a signature
 * failure on a good release — the exact class of divergence `fleetStatement`
 * exists to prevent, one level down.
 *
 * THE STRIPPER IS STRING-AWARE, and that is not fastidiousness: a naive
 * `/\/\/.*$/` strip eats the `//` in any URL, and these configs carry several
 * (`$schema`, the observability docs link). It tracks quoting and escapes so a
 * `//` inside a string stays, and a `"` inside a comment is ignored.
