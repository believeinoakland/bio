/* `directoryPersonRefs(entities, view)` (R7): a staff directory's contact entries as person references.
 *
 * THE KEY STAYS THE ADDRESS. `staff_directory` keys an entry by its address because that is the identifier
 * the document assigns (its own header); a person's name is not. So each reference here is keyed by
 * `contact_key`, the entry's address, and a name is read beside it only when the entry's line, with its
 * address, phone numbers and staff-title words removed, leaves exactly ONE name-shaped span. A two-column
 * directory puts two people's text on one line (its document B), and any other count is not divided by
 * guess.
 *
 * A NAME READ HERE IS A NAME ALONE: grade C (K1484 row 12; K1488 (b): an identifier at both ends earns A, a
 * name corroborated by a fact true at both dates B, a name alone C). It is never more, whatever matches it
 * later: `match_grade` is a ceiling `entities` applies, not a score this module raises. */
