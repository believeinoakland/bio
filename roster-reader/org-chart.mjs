/* `org_chart` (R3, R4, R5): a document naming an organisation's units and posts in chart form.
 *
 * MEASURED ON REAL DOCUMENTS from the same bucket, read through the plane (`test/fixtures/`): the police
 * department's chart of March 2021 (units only, one box to a line or two), its Bureau of Services chart of
 * September 2018 (units with a post under each), the City Administrator's chart of October 2021 (posts with
 * their holders, several boxes to a line), and the Public Works chart of September 2021 (a staffing chart:
 * hundreds of posts with their holders, vacancies named). Fenced against the rosters, the directories and
 * their look-alikes, and FW-18's substance documents.
 *
 * WHAT TEXT CARRIES OF A CHART, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. A chart is boxes joined by lines. Text extraction
 * carries the boxes' LABELS, in an order the page layout decides, and nothing of the lines: which box sits
 * under which is a drawing, and no reading of the text can recover it. So this type reads the units and
 * posts as labels, a name beside a post only where one line holds exactly the post and one name, and a
 * reporting pair ONLY where the words of the document state it ("X reports to Y"); `pairs_why` says so
 * every time. Reading a hierarchy from the order of labels would be the guess R10 forbids.
 *
 * THE PRINCIPLE: (1) BOXES ARE THE BODY — at least CHART_FLOOR lines are box labels (a unit: a kind-of-unit
 * word ends or opens the line; a post: one of the view's staff titles; or a holder's name alone), at least
 * CHART_MIN_LABELS of them name a unit or a post, and box labels are at least CHART_SHARE of the lines;
 * (2) BOX LABELS ARE SHORT — the median line is at most CHART_SHORT words; (3) a document that names itself,
 * with the view's `roster_words`, only as a roster is not a chart, and one that names itself a chart is
 * raised from LIKELY to CERTAIN; self-naming is never sufficient alone.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE: a chart whose boxes are an image (one measured chart has no text layer; it is not
 * read here, and nothing is said about it beyond that no text was read); a chart whose labels are mostly
 * prose (the community-safety chart, which falls to `generic`); and, without the view's staff titles, the
 * posts, so a staffing chart that prints holders under titles is a LIKELY roster as much as a chart. */
