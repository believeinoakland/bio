/* `rosterSource(reads)` (R12; N614, K1505 (6), K1683; `people` R18, R19): the roster source `people.staffingAt`
 * asks, in place of the one `plane` registered that answered "held as a table, not read".
 *
 * THIS MODULE HOLDS NO STORE (layer 1). `reads({organisation, viewer})` is the store's read, composed and handed in
 * by the composition root: it answers the held roster documents and roster tables of that organisation that the
 * viewer may see. Which captures and tables those are is `plane`'s choice (its composition), never this module's;
 * this source only reads what it is handed, a document by R2 (`staff_roster`'s `parse`) and a table's columns by R6
 * (`rosterColumns`), and answers each as `{source, as_of, rows}`.
 *
 * WHAT `reads` ANSWERS, read leniently because the store's shape is `plane`'s: a list of items, or `{items, view}`
 * (or `{rosters, view}`), or a refusal `{ok: false, why}`. An item is
 *   - a TABLE when it carries `header` (its header cells) and `rows` (each a list of cells in the header's order,
 *     or an object keyed by header text): `{source, header, rows, as_of?, view?}`;
 *   - a DOCUMENT otherwise: `{source, text, type?, view?, at?}`, `text` a string or interface I2's text shape, read
 *     as docprofile's `readText` reads it (`flattenText`, `makeLocator`). `type: "org_chart"` is read by R3: a
 *     post that names its holder on its own line is a row `{name, title}`; a box with no name is not a row.
 * The view an item is read under is its own `view`, else the answer's, else docprofile's reader view (K39).
 *
 * EVERYTHING IS A READING (R10). Each roster states its own `as_of`; nothing here says that a row's person held
 * the post at `at`, which is answered back only as the date asked. A contact column is never read and a contact
 * point inside a cell is left unread (R4). Nothing is written. It never throws: a `reads` that is absent, throws,
 * answers a promise or answers nothing usable gives the level "held as a table, not read" with why, and an item
 * that cannot be read is named in `unread` with why (R11). */
