/* `staff_roster` (R1, R2, R4, R5): a document whose body is a list of one organisation's people or posts,
 * with names and titles but no contact points — the shape `staff_directory` cannot see (its header names
 * the board roster and the committee roster as documents it does not recognise).
 *
 * MEASURED ON REAL DOCUMENTS, fetched from the bucket the staff directory was measured on
 * (`cao-94612.s3.amazonaws.com`, 2026-10-05) and read through the plane (`test/fixtures/capture.mjs`,
 * `test/fixtures/roster-documents.json`):
 *   - the Workforce Development Board roster (`WDB-Roster-10-15-2018.pdf`): a numbered row per member,
 *     name beside an organisation and a term. It never names itself a roster in its text;
 *   - the Council's committee roster (`2025-Committee-Membership-Staff-Roster-1.10.25.pdf`): per
 *     committee a `Chair: <name>` line, members' names alone, and `<post>: <name>` lines for the assigned
 *     staff; it names itself "ROSTER AND ASSIGNED STAFF";
 *   - the Reimagining Public Safety advisory board rosters (`RPS-Advisory-Board-Members_rev.pdf`): a
 *     numbered row per member, name beside a council district.
 * Fenced against, by name (R9): the staff directory's four look-alikes (the candidate contact list, the
 * dated meeting schedule, the business recycling directory; the board roster is the positive here), its
 * four directories, a FEIR chapter that names itself "Roster of Commenters", a blank event sign-in sheet
 * that names itself "EVENT PARTICIPANT ROSTER", and the substance documents FW-18 measured.
 *
 * THE PRINCIPLE, four facts, then a raise:
 *   (1) ROWS ARE THE BODY — at least ROSTER_FLOOR lines carry a name with something more on the line (a
 *       title, a unit, an organisation), and lines that carry a name are at least ROSTER_SHARE of the
 *       document's lines. Prose that mentions people fails the share; a sign-in form has no names.
 *   (2) NO CONTACT POINTS AS ITS BODY — a document whose rows carry addresses or phone numbers is a
 *       directory or a contact list: at least DIRECTORY_FLOOR addresses at one domain is
 *       `staff_directory`'s shape, and contact points on half the rows is a contact list. Not matched.
 *   (3) NOT DATED — the dated-rows rule of `staff_directory`, applied here: dates as many as half the
 *       rows make the rows events that name people, not people.
 *   (4) NOT A CHART — posts or units printed on lines of their own, as many as the rows, are a chart's
 *       boxes; and a document that names itself, with the view's words, only as a chart is not a roster.
 *   Self-naming (a short line the view's `roster_words` match as a roster) raises LIKELY to CERTAIN and is
 *   never sufficient alone: the FEIR chapter and the sign-in sheet both name themselves a roster.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE: a roster of names printed in capitals, or in a script without case; a roster whose
 * rows were laid out as a table the text read column by column (the names in one run, the titles in
 * another); and which of two capitalised phrases on one line is the person (so it does not divide such a
 * line: the row is kept whole as `line`, never paired by guess, R2). */
