# The requirements canon

**Status** · DRAFT by BOB #37, 2026-09-25, for Bob's approval (TRANSITION.md T3). The canon is the one place every module's requirements cite, by section (PROCESS-MECHANICS §1, P5). Files stay where they are until T8 moves them here. A document listed "by section" is canon only in the sections named; the rest is history.

## Canon

**Mission and product requirements**

| document | canon part | one line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Complete_Roadmap_v5.md` | §§1–12 | the mission of record: values, operational principles, trust hierarchy |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Design_Requirements_v2.md` | whole | the fifteen design requirements; the system fails if any is violated |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Functional_Architecture_v3.md` | the functional analysis, not the v3 annotations | Information, Analysis, Action: every function a group needs, and where human judgment is required |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_System_Design.md` | whole except §3's state column | the whole system at level 0: every construct and its home document |
| Bob's product rulings (DEC-n), in `docs/development/DECISIONS.md` and quoted in the home documents | each ruling | binding doctrine; at T6 each ruling a module rests on is cited in its requirements |

**Construct designs (level 1)**

| document | canon part | one line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Content_Framework_v0_10.md` | whole | content: extraction substrate (Part I) and the content, meaning and retrieval model (Part II) |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Intake_Doctrine_v1_1.md` | whole | how material enters the record: provenance, the intake contract, capture grades |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Membership_Architecture_v2.md` | whole | members, administrators, capabilities, invitations, projects, verified export |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Case_Making_v0_1.md` | whole | the inquiry, the claim, the case |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Declared_Bias_v0_1.md` | whole | bias as a declared, justified construct; hunch debt; masking safeguards |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Interaction_Constructs_v0_1.md` | whole | QUEUE and ACT, the rung ladder, UNDETERMINED as a display primitive |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Assistant_and_AI_Roles_v0_1.md` | whole | the assistant and the AI roles |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Publication_v0_1.md` | whole | publication, audiences and communications |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Distribution_v0_1.md` | whole | installer, releases, fleet, multi-instance |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_State_Rules_Consistency_v1_5.md` | §3 onward | the record's shape and rules: ids, schemas, state machines, relationships, invariants I-1…I-20 |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Technical_Architecture_Decisions_v10.md` | the general rules, not the mechanisms | the technology decisions that remain live |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Bundle_Skill_Composite_Design_v1_7.md` | the bundle format, promotion semantics and C-series checks | the format the plane must still satisfy |

**Construct detail (level 2)**

| document | canon part | one line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/development/CONTENT-EXTENT-DESIGN-SPACE.md` | §6 and the doctrine it records | the content-extent primitive, as built |

| `docs/development/ARCHIVE-FALLBACK.md` | whole | what a web archive can and cannot attest |
| `docs/development/SOURCE-ACCESS.md` | the rulings | access parity and the allowlist |

| `docs/development/MULTI-INSTANCE-ISOLATION.md` | whole | what must not collide between instances in one account |

## Reference, not canon

Kept and citable as evidence. Never cited as a requirement.

| document | why not canon |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/development/STORE-AS-CACHE.md` | research; its adopted tables live in the Content Framework Part II §14.2–14.3 |
| `docs/development/RETRIEVAL-PROBE.md`, `docs/development/CAPTURE-SCALING.md` | measurements |
| `docs/development/PRACTICE-SURVEY.md` | a survey of other tools |
| `docs/development/research/README.md`, `DATA-MODEL.md`, `RECONCILED.md` | the case-making research; Case Making v0.1 is the design |
| `docs/development/UI-PLAN.md` | a plan whose state is stale; its intent is in the Interaction Constructs and UI-KICKOFF |
| `docs/architecture/BIO_Communications_Platforms.md` | an April 2026 platform selection that predates the plane |
| `docs/architecture/CONSTRUCTS.md` | a dated inventory of July 2026 |
