/* The words rule for this module's own sentences (setup-words R13, R14; K874): every sentence a member reads is
   read through `localize` under its id, and each id is named by a test that reaches the sentence. Each test
   compares with `localize` at the same id and English, so the list, once regenerated, answers the same text. */
