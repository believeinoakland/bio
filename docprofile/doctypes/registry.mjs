/* The CONTENT-TYPE axis: a second registry of the SAME shape as the stack axis.
 *
 * Both axes are `makeRegistry()` instances of the one recogniser engine (site-profiles'
 * recogniser.mjs), which is the whole claim of framework §4: a third axis is a third
 * `makeRegistry()`, not a third loop.
 *
 * THIS MODULE HOLDS NO CONTENT TYPE (R36; T34-8, N549). The registry starts EMPTY and
 * holds only what a composer registers through the seam below: `plane` wires
 * `doctypes`' `registerDoctypes(registerDoctype)` and the other readers' registrations,
 * `generic` (the fallback) last. The seven copies this module kept, and their
 * registration by default (K1513 (3)), were deleted once `plane` registered `doctypes`'
 * types (T33-90). Which types exist, what each one reads and the measurements each was
 * written from are `doctypes`' (its R1) and the other readers'; this file is the seam,
 * the order and the `also` pass.
 *
 * The rule the deleted types were written under holds for whatever is registered here:
 * a content type invented from what a document probably looks like is a type that
 * reassures people about things it has not understood. With no type recognising a
 * document, the registered fallback reports change without describing it, which is
 * noisy and honest; with no fallback registered at all, NO_TYPE below says so. */

 *  twelve. The engine cannot say so: `recognise` stops at the first CERTAIN detection,

 *  invisible. That break is the STACK axis's behaviour too and is not this axis's to
 *  move, so the multi-class fact is produced here instead, by asking every registered
 *  type independently.
 *
 *  IT CHANGES NO VERDICT. `type`, `confidence`, `signals` and `considered` are exactly
 *  what they were; `also` is a new field beside them, and the plane's profile stamp
 *  reads named fields rather than the whole object, so nothing downstream moves. A
 *  reader is handed the same list through `ctx.alsoSatisfies` so it can state the fact
 *  in the reading's own facts, which is the surface a member actually sees.
