/* Content types: WHAT a document is, as distinct from HOW it was built.
 *
 * A separate axis from the stack handler, and the separation is load-bearing. A
 * meeting calendar served by Legistar on ASP.NET and one served by Granicus on
 * something else are the SAME KIND OF THING built two ways: the questions "what
 * counts as a meaningful change here" and "what connections does this imply" have
 * one answer for both, while "which bytes are per-render machinery" has two. The
 * earlier version hung a kind() off the stack handler, which meant every new stack
 * re-answered every content question from scratch.
 *
 * A content type answers four things and nothing else:
 *
 *   detect   is this that kind of document?
 *   parse    what is IN it? entities, with stable keys and their own facts.
 *   assess   given two parses, did anything MEANINGFUL change, and how badly?
 *   connections  what referential and temporal links does this imply?
 *
 * THE STANDING RULE, inherited and it applies harder here than anywhere. A content
 * type that reports change when nothing meaningful happened costs a member some
 * attention. One that stays quiet when something did puts a false reassurance in
 * the record. So an unmeasured content type is NOT written: the generic type below
 * reports any substantive difference without describing it, which is noisy and
 * honest, and the noise is the signal that the type is worth measuring.
 */

   is the shell case, which the stack axis already settles at layer 1 of assess(); a

 *  would have looked like a document that is not an ordinance rather than like a

/** How many times a document NAMES ITSELF as a kind, on a line of its own.
 *
 *  THIS IS M0-32's DEFECT CLASS ANSWERED STRUCTURALLY. All five defects its
 *  recogniser made were ONE shape: a REFERENCE to a kind mistaken for MEMBERSHIP
 *  of it — a staff report that mentions an ordinance is not an ordinance. The
 *  same shape was measured in this item, twice and in both directions, on real
 *  documents:
 *
 *    - a set of Oakland minutes says `On The July 21, 2026 City Council Agenda On
 *      Consent` of nearly every item, and the registered `meeting_agenda` type
 *      read the whole document as an agenda at CERTAIN confidence because of it;
 *    - the same minutes carry two lines that are exactly `Agenda`, which are the
 *      wrapped tails of attachment titles (`Draft July 28, 2026 Cancelled Finance
 *      And Management Committee` / `Agenda`) — a reference that even survives
 *      line anchoring;
 *    - and the agenda of that same meeting says `There Are No Minutes To Be
 *      Approved`, which is a reference to minutes inside an agenda.
 *
 *  WHAT SEPARATES THEM IS NOT THE WORD, IT IS THE RATE. A document's self-naming
 *  sits in its masthead, and a masthead is PAGE FURNITURE: it recurs once per
 *  page. Measured on three real documents — 25 occurrences over 25 pages of one
 *  set of minutes, 37 over 37 pages of another, 33 over 33 pages of the agenda —
 *  against 2 for the reference and 0 the other way. A reference occurs once or
 *  twice wherever the prose happened to need it.
 *
 *  So a type asks for the COUNT and decides what the count entitles it to. That is
 *  a principle (furniture recurs, a mention does not) rather than a list of
 *  spellings, which is what WORKER.md means by inverting instead of lengthening.
 *
 *  WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated because the sentence is load-bearing: a genuinely
 *  ONE-PAGE document of any of these kinds names itself ONCE and is
 *  indistinguishable by this test from a one-line reference. Every type here
 *  therefore keeps a path that reaches `likely` on other evidence alone, and none
 *  of them refuses a document for naming itself only once. */

 *  rather than only the profile.
