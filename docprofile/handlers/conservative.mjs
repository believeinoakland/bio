/* The handler for a document nothing recognises.
 *
 * This is the most important handler in the package, because it is the one that
 * runs when we are wrong about everything else. Its job is to be USELESS in the
 * safe direction: it claims almost nothing is machinery, nothing at all is
 * decoration, and therefore any difference in the bytes is reported as a possible
 * change to the substance.
 *
 * The consequence is deliberate. An unrecognised source will report change on
 * every fetch if it happens to churn, and a member will see noise. That is the
 * cost of not silently telling somebody their evidence is unchanged when it is
 * not, and it is the right way round: noise is annoying and a false "unchanged"
 * is a false claim in the record, discovered by the party the claim is aimed at.
 *
 * The noise is also a SIGNAL, and it is how this package grows. A source that
 * reports change constantly under this handler is a source that needs measuring
 * and a handler writing, and the pattern is visible rather than buried.
