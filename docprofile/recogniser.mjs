/* One extension shape for every axis: the RECOGNISER and its REGISTRY.
 *
 * This is §4 of BIO_Content_Framework_v0_10 made real, and it is the reconciliation
 * D-68 / CONSTRUCTS Step 0 exists to perform. The inventory's worst finding was that
 * two axes (host stack, content type) each grew their OWN copy of the same
 * apparatus in a day: two confidence ladders, two ordered registries, two
 * `identify`-shaped loops. They were never two ideas. They are one, written twice.
 *
 * A RECOGNISER answers one question about a capture and declares how sure it is:
 *
 *     detect(ctx) -> { match, confidence, signals[] }
 *     key, label, version          // machine name, words for a member, and the
 *                                  //   version so a judgment can be found and
 *                                  //   revised when the rule later improves
 *
 * A REGISTRY holds the recognisers for ONE axis, ordered most specific first. The
 * first CERTAIN detection wins; short of that the highest confidence wins; and a
 * fallback that never matches is reached only by falling through and is always the
 * conservative one. That is the WHOLE extension mechanism: adding a host stack, a
 * content type, or an axis nobody has thought of yet is the same act — write a
 * recogniser, register it. The test of whether this consolidation worked is that the
 * ENTITY axis (CONSTRUCTS Step 4) costs one `makeRegistry()` and nothing else.

/* The one confidence ladder, used by every axis. `certain` is a signal only this
   thing produces; `likely` is consistent but not conclusive; `possible` is a weak
   hint; `none` is the fallback's floor. Confidence below `certain` changes the
   answer (framework invariant 5): a merely-likely recogniser declines to narrow and
   the conservative default applies. Content-type recognisers simply never use
   `possible`; the ladder is still one ladder. */

 *  `isFallback` names the member that is returned when nothing detects — the
 *  conservative handler on the stack axis, the generic type on the content axis.
 *  Both carry `fallback: true`, so the default suffices and no axis needs its own
 *  registry code. That is the point.
 *
 *  `recognise(ctx)` always returns a member: an unrecognised capture gets the
 *  fallback rather than an error, because refusing to profile would just move the
