/* The change pipeline: recognising change in LAYERS.
 *
 * RULED by Bob, 2026-07-30. Recognising change is layered, and the layers run in
 * this order because each one is cheap relative to the next and each one can
 * settle the question outright:
 *
 *   L1  WHICH STACK is this? Without that, nothing below can be trusted, because
 *       the same bytes mean different things on different stacks.
 *   L2  Is anything different AT THE BYTE LEVEL? If not, that is NOTED, not
 *       discarded: a dated first-party statement that the source is still serving
 *       what the record holds is evidence, and it is the primary contemporaneity
 *       route's raw material.
 *   L3  Is the difference NOTEWORTHY? Page state, security tokens and ad slots
 *       differ on every fetch by design. Furniture differs when the site changes,
 *       not when the document does.
 *   L4  WHAT TYPE OF CONTENT changed? A calendar is not an article is not a
 *       regulation is not a staff directory is not an agenda. This is a SEPARATE
 *       axis from the stack: a calendar served by Legistar and one served by
 *       Granicus are the same kind of thing built two ways.
 *   L5  Is the change MEANINGFUL for that type? A calendar whose window has moved
 *       a week is not a changed calendar. A staff member's title is another matter.
 *       Minutes appearing after a meeting was scheduled to occur is another again.
 *   L6  What CONNECTIONS does it imply? Referential, between related content, and
 *       temporal, across time. Different meanings, understood differently by people
 *       and their assistants, and presented differently.
 *
 * WHY LAYERS AND NOT ONE FUNCTION. The previous version conflated L1 through L4
 * inside a single monitor() and inherited a false positive from doing so: the
 * Legistar calendar's visible range is "This Month", MEASURED, so a week later
 * meetings have scrolled out of the window and a membership diff reports them as
 * REMOVED, which is the heaviest signal this system has. A meeting leaving the
 * visible window is not a public record being delisted, and no amount of care at
 * L3 could tell the difference, because the distinction is not about bytes or
 * furniture. It is about what a calendar IS.
 *
 * Each layer returns a verdict and may STOP. Nothing below runs speculatively,
 * which keeps the expensive parsing off the overwhelming majority of checks where
 * the bytes are identical or the difference is machinery.
