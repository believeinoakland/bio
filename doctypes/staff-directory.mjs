/* A staff directory: a document whose BODY IS a list of one organisation's people (or
 * offices) with the points at which each can be reached.
 *
 * FW-20, the FOURTH and last class in M0-32's measured order (`MEASUREMENTS.md` M-18;
 * `EXTRACTION-BREADTH-DESIGN.md` §2's table, row 4) — ~395 items (+/-272) scaled to the
 * text-bearing stratum, the smallest class by a wide margin.
 *
 * WHY THIS TYPE WAS NOT WRITTEN BY FW-18, AND WHAT CHANGED. FW-18 measured 0 of 30
 * name-matched directory PDFs decodable at TIER 1 and withheld the type (D-376), calling
 * the class "a tier-3 gap wearing a content-type gap's clothes". FW-20 re-took that
 * census through the plane WITH ITS FLEET BOUND (`docs/development/measurements/M-121.md`;
 * the census script was retired in T18 and is in git history) and the premise did not survive: the undetermined markers
 * on those documents are `no_tounicode` — fonts with no Unicode map — which is TIER 2's
 * case, not a missing text layer, so tier 3 is never asked. With the tier-2 member bound,
 * 56 of 57 name-matched documents read from text. The class was never unreadable to the
 * plane; it was unreadable to the tier-1-only instrument that measured it.
 *
 * MEASURED ON REAL DOCUMENTS, fetched from `cao-94612.s3.amazonaws.com` on 2026-09-23
 * and read through the plane's own `op=acquire` with the committed pdf-worker bundle:
 *
 *   A · documents/Neighborhood-Services-Section-Directory-Rev-06-14-22.pdf — the City's
 *       "Neighborhood Services Staff Beat & Program Directory". 30,870 bytes, 1 page,
 *       2,092 characters at tier 2 (1,303 `no_tounicode` markers at tier 1). Each row is
 *       a coordinator, the police beats assigned to them, an @oaklandca.gov address and
 *       an extension.
 *   B · documents/Neighborhood-Services-Division-Staff-0823.pdf — the same division's
 *       staff sheet, laid out in TWO COLUMNS, so a name and its address sit on different
 *       lines. Its file name matches none of FW-18's name patterns: M0-32 measured that
 *       a name-only census recovers 0% of directories, and this is one it would miss.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS TYPE WAS BUILT NOT TO MAKE — the liar's pass. A recogniser that
 * matches "a list of names with phone numbers and addresses" matches a great deal that is
 * not a staff directory, and four real documents from the same bucket spring it:
 *
 *   - the 2018 ELECTION CANDIDATE CONTACT LIST: fifty-odd people, each with a phone and
 *     an address — but at gmail, yahoo, sonic and their own campaign domains. They are
 *     candidates, not one organisation's staff;
 *   - the NCPC ZOOM MEETING DATES: every row names a City coordinator and her
 *     @oaklandca.gov address — ONE domain, the directory's own signature — but every
 *     row is a MEETING, dated. A calendar that names its contacts. This is M0-32's one
 *     defect class, a REFERENCE (to staff) read as MEMBERSHIP (of a directory), and it
 *     is the negative this type is fenced against by name;
 *   - the BUSINESS RECYCLING SERVICE PROVIDER DIRECTORY, which names itself a directory
 *     on its first line and carries the City's own contact address — a directory, of
 *     businesses, that REFERENCES the City's staff;
 *   - the WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD roster: a list of people with no contact points.
 *
 * THE PRINCIPLE, and it is three facts rather than a list of spellings:
 *   (1) DENSITY — contact points are the body of the document, not a line in it. At
 *       least DIRECTORY_FLOOR distinct addresses.
 *   (2) ONE ORGANISATION — a staff directory lists the people of ONE body, so their
 *       addresses share that body's domain. The candidate list fails here.
 *   (3) NOT DATED — a directory's entries are people; a schedule's entries are events
 *       that name people. When the document carries dates in the same order of number
 *       as its contact points, the contacts are attributes of dated rows and the
 *       document is a calendar. The NCPC dates fail here.
 * Self-naming (a title line calling the document a directory, staff list, roster or
 * contacts) raises LIKELY to CERTAIN and is never sufficient alone — the recycling
 * directory names itself and is refused by (1).
 *
 * WHAT THIS MATCHER CANNOT SEE, stated because the sentence is load-bearing:
 *   - a directory with NO EMAIL ADDRESSES (phone numbers only, or names and titles only
 *     — the Council's committee roster and the org charts in the same bucket are of this
 *     shape). (2) cannot be established from a phone number, so these are NOT
 *     recognised; they fall to `generic`, which is noisy and honest.
 *   - a directory of OFFICES at one domain is recognised exactly as a directory of
 *     people is. M0-32's class definition ("a roster of people OR OFFICES with contact
 *     points") includes both, so this is the class, not an overreach — but the reader
 *     does not tell them apart.
 *   - an organisation whose staff use personal addresses fails (2).
 *   - it does not pair a name with an address across lines. On a two-column page
 *     (document B) an address's own line may carry two people's text or none; the
 *     entry's `line` fact is that line, verbatim, never a pairing this reader guessed. */
