/* Captures the codifier fixtures R17 names, from the codifier's open JSON API
 * (`measures-T33/time-law.md` §4–§5): one jurisdiction's code served one document per
 * section, and its charter served one document per article. Run by hand, never by a test:
 *   node doctypes/test/capture-codifier.mjs
 * It writes `fixtures/codifier.json`: for each response, the address it came from, when,
 * the sha256 and length of the bytes received, and the documents kept from it, each as the
 * codifier served it (`Id`, `Title`, `Content`). Trimmed only in which documents are kept. */
