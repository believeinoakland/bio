/* Build agent-worker into ONE self-contained module, committed.
 *
 * ---- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHOSE DECISION IT IS -------------------------
 *
 * `wrangler.jsonc` recorded FLEET's ruling that THE SOURCE DEPLOYS, NOT A
 * BUNDLE, because a committed bundle is "a second place its version lives and a
 * committed artifact that can drift from its source (D-106's class)". The ruling
 * named its own reversal condition. **BOB reversed it on 2026-09-10**, under the
 * standing delegation and as MECHANISM rather than doctrine, answering DIST's
 * DELEGATION: adopt the GUARD pattern.
 *
 * The forcing fact is DIST's, measured: **`newgroup` is a Worker. It cannot run
 * `wrangler` and it cannot bundle**, and this member is THREE modules
 * (`index.mjs` imports `./harness.mjs` and `./subsession.mjs`), so the one-part
 * script upload an installer has cannot resolve them. An installable fleet needs
 * one bundled, hashed, signed artifact per member.
 *
 * **The drift objection is ANSWERED, not overruled.** The committed artifact
 * ships beside `dist/agent-worker.bundle.json` — its sha256, its byte length,
 * the exact recipe, and the sha256 of every input — and
 * `bio-plane/test/fleetbundles.test.mjs` asserts the artifact is byte-identical
 * to a fresh build of its source. **A stale artifact FAILS instead of shipping.**
 * That is the instrument this record always reaches for: a hash-verified copy of
 * exact bytes, never a second codebase.
 *
 * THE MEMBER STILL DEPENDS ON NOTHING FROM npm. The recipe lives in
 * `bio-plane/scripts/fleet-bundle.mjs` and `esbuild` resolves from the plane's
 * install, the same way `newgroup/scripts/embed-release.mjs` already expects
 * "the sibling ../bio-plane tree with its devDependencies installed".
 *
 * Run from agent-worker/: `npm run build`.
