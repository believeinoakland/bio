/* T46-19's NEGATIVE CONTROL DRIVER (K874) for `t46.test.mjs`: each arm breaks the source in one place T46's ids (R6,
 * R30, R51, R72, R76, R79, R80) depend on, runs the suite, and requires it to FAIL, naming the requirement ids the
 * failing lines carry.
 *
 *     node test/t46.control.mjs          # every arm, in order
 *     node test/t46.control.mjs 3        # one arm
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT A `.test.mjs`: it edits real sources while it runs (cascade.control.mjs' rules): snapshots are held
 * in memory and written back in a `finally`, every restore is verified by sha256, and the suite's exit status is read
 * from `spawnSync().status`. `git checkout` is never used.
