/* R32, R33, R6, R10, R29, R36, R57 — WHICH CLAUDE ACCOUNT SERVES THE ACT, driven pure AND through the endpoint (K1502,
 * K1755: the member's own reference, or the group's API key, each serving one member's act). `src/cascade.mjs` is the
 * one judgement of the account that arrived, at its own level; this suite walks it as a plain module first, then hands
 * accounts to `POST /run` under miniflare and asserts what travels on the wire: the account named at its level without
 * its secret, an absent, bad or revoked one refused by name before any plane call, and the run's recorded member and
 * the member whose act the account serves refusing to differ, at either level.
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL: `test/cascade.control.mjs` was written against the three-level cascade (K1429) and its arms name
 * source lines T33-57 removed; it is stale until re-armed against this file (recorded in the job's record). The arms
 * this suite must fail on, if re-armed: the published-value check in `levelState` removed (section 1's revoked arm,
 * section 4's published case); the `RUN_NAMES_A_DIFFERENT_PAYER` guard removed (section 5); `accountOf`'s NO_ACCOUNT
 * refusal removed (section 4).
