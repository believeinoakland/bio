/* agent-worker — T36's requirements (T36-24; N695, K2126): the pack read apart, from `op=agentpack`, never from
 * `op=affordances`, by a run (R48), an ask and a draft (R59), and the op declarations that say so (R37), AT THE
 * MEMBER'S INTERFACE: its default export `fetch(request, env)`, driven in this process by `test/inprocess.mjs` with a
 * recording `PLANE` binding and the global `fetch` answered as the model API answers. Every request that reached the
 * binding is captured, so "never `op=affordances`" is counted, not read off the source.
 *
 * Why it matters at the release (K2126): once control-plane drops `pack` and `fences` from `op=affordances` (T36-37),
 * a member that still read them there would refuse every segment and every ask. The drives below include a plane from
 * before that change, whose `affordances` still carries a pack, so a member that fell back to it would be seen. */
