/* R109, R110, R111 — THE ONE ROAD TO A MEMBER'S ASSISTANT: THE REMOTE SESSION, AND WHETHER IT MAY BE TAKEN YET
 * (N1196; K3607–K3611, K3615; DEC-301).
 *
 * The assistant runs in a Claude Code cloud session that `agent-runner`'s second class (bound here as `REMOTE`, a
 * Durable Object namespace with no container) creates on the member's own sign-in. Every path of this member that
 * reaches a runner (`/ask`, `/run`, `/draft` in every task, `/transcribe` and `/signin`) reaches it through `remoteOf`,
 * which answers `env.REMOTE` and nothing else: the local container binding (`RUNNER`) is not declared, not read and
 * not named by any code here (R109). The binding is passed to `agent-model` as the `runner` it already takes, because
 * `REMOTE` accepts the conversation's connection and request unchanged (`agent-runner` R36).
 *
 * WHETHER IT MAY BE TAKEN (R110; K3610: until the remote path works on a copy, that copy's assistant does not run).
 * `remoteVersion` asks the remote class its `GET /remote/version` (`agent-runner` R40) on an instance named
 * `VERSION_INSTANCE`, there being no member in that question. `remoteReady` is true exactly when that answered and the
 * member's check record, kept in this member's own storage (`CheckRecord`, bound `CHECKS`, one instance per member; BOB's
 * K3693), states a passed check at that very version (R111's `check` step writes it with `recordCheck`). A check from
 * another version is no check, and a copy with no `CHECKS` binding has none. Nothing here throws, and nothing here keeps
 * anything but that one record, a version and a time (R36): each answer is asked of the instances and used once. */
