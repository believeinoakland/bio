/* R54–R56 — `POST /ask`: ONE MEMBER'S QUESTION, ANSWERED UNDER THAT MEMBER'S GRANT AND THE ACCOUNT THAT SERVES THEIR
 * ASK, AND CHECKED BY THE
 * PLANE BEFORE ANY WORD OF IT IS RETURNED (Q1-4; ladders §9.4 L1; K1450, K1474, K1479, K1502, K1601).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A member asks; the plane mints the member a short-lived, read-only `ai` grant (credentials R27) and hands
 * this member the question, the grant and the Claude account that serves that member's ask (R6's shape, as
 * `credentials.accountFor` answers it: the member's own reference, else the group's API key while held and on, K1755),
 * with the earlier turns of this one ask, which the member's device holds (nothing is kept here or in the plane,
 * K1450). An ask the group's key serves is still the member's own ask. This member then:
 *
 *   1. asks the plane whether the member is over their use ceiling (`op=askceiling`, ai-runs R50), before any model
 *      call, relaying a refusal unchanged (R43);
 *   2. reads the pack the ask is instructed by (`op=agentpack`, R48), whose `ask` layer carries the closed-book rule;
 *   3. INTERPRETS and READS: one conversation in which the model reads the question (asking at most one clarifying
 *      question, answers R3) and writes its queries, reading the record only through the grant and only the ops of
 *      `ASK_OPS` (R55) — a tool call naming any other op is refused here, before any plane call, and the refusal is
 *      the tool's result;
 *   4. COMPOSES: the same transcript, with reading closed, answered in `answers`' contract (its R3);
 *   5. CHECKS: hands the answer to the plane's `answers` checks (`op=askcheck`, `checkAnswer` over the read log the
 *      plane holds for the grant, its R4) and returns ONLY what they pass, with what they withheld named.
 *
 * It writes no run row and no observation; it reports each conversation's `usage` to the plane (`op=askusage`, ai-runs
 * R48's `countAskUsage`), with `calls`, the model calls that usage covers, exactly as `agent-model` R6 answers them
 * (N588; a `calls` it did not state is passed as `null`). Progress is streamed as each step begins, and no
 * progress event carries text the checks have not passed: a step's name, and a read's op, nothing more.
 *
 * THE STREAM (K1601 (5); R113, T50; N1195, K3602, DEC-298): NDJSON (`application/x-ndjson`), one object per line, each
 * written the moment its step begins and held for nothing: `{event: "step", step: "interpreting"}` before the first model
 * turn; `{event: "read", op, record}` before each read, `record` the id of the record that read names (null when it
 * names none), so a screen draws "Reading {document}" from a field; `{event: "composing", found, count}` when reading
 * closes, `count` the passages the reads found and `found` whether there is at least one; `{event: "checking", count}`
 * before the plane's check is asked, `count` the passages the composed answer cites; one `{event: "checked", passage,
 * found}` for each cited passage as the check answers, `found` whether the check passed it; and last exactly one of
 * `{event: "answer", ok: true, answer, withheld, untested?}` (R79: the test-instance label the door sent, unchanged),
 * `{event: "refused", code: "ASK_CHECK_FAILED", cited, found: 0}` (the answer cites holdings and the check withheld
 * every one: no `answer` follows, so no word the check did not pass reaches the member) or `{event: "refused",
 * …refusal}`. No event before the last carries text the model wrote. A refusal made before any model call (R1, R2,
 * `NO_GRANT`, `NO_ACCOUNT`, `ASSISTANT_REMOTE_NOT_READY`, the ceiling) is answered as plain JSON with its status, not
 * as a stream.
 *
 * THE BOUNDS are `run-rules`' `ASK_BOUNDS` (its R17), their provisional defaults (M-Q7 measures them): `turns` model
 * turns, `bytes` of the record's answers read into the model, `wall_ms` from start to answer, `reads` of the record. */
