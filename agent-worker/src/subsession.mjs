/* FL-5 / IS-9(a) — THE SUB-SESSION CONTRACTS: WHAT GOES OUT, AND WHAT MAY COME
 * BACK. Pure, for the same recorded reason `harness.mjs` is pure.
 *
 * `INVESTIGATIVE-SESSION.md` §14b.1 is the whole item, and it is a MEMORY MODEL
 * rather than a speed optimisation:
 *
 *   *"Sub-sessions return REPORTS, not their reading. A search sub-session reads
 *    widely in its own context and hands back what it found — never the
 *    documents. This is why §14a's fan-out is not merely a speed optimisation:
 *    it is the memory model. Without it a run drowns in its own evidence."*
 *
 *   *"The consequence for the fan-out is a RULE, not a preference: a sub-session
 *    that returns documents rather than reports HAS DEFEATED THE ARCHITECTURE.
 *    Its contract is a REPORT with a citation, and the parent re-reads by address
 *    if it needs the bytes. The same contract is where §14's fence lands: the
 *    spawn payload carries no bias manifest, BY CONSTRUCTION."*
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS IS AN EXACT KEY SET AND NOT A LIST OF BANNED FIELDS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The obvious spelling of "never documents" is a denylist — refuse `bytes`,
 * `body`, `text`, `html`, `pdf`, `base64`. **That is the defect WORKER.md names
 * in its own words: invert, do not lengthen a list. A list of spellings goes
 * stale the moment a fourth is written**, and the fourth here is free — a
 * sub-session returning `{ raw: <the whole document> }` passes a denylist of
 * three and has defeated the architecture exactly as thoroughly.
 *
 * So the rule is inverted and it is TWO structural properties, neither of which
 * knows any field name a document might arrive under:
 *
 *   1. **AN EXACT KEY SET.** A REPORT carries `REPORT_KEYS` and nothing else; a
 *      citation carries `CITATION_KEYS` and nothing else. An unrecognised key is
 *      REFUSED AND NAMED — never dropped, because a caller told its input was
 *      silently discarded learns nothing and will send it again.
 *   2. **A BOUND ON THE PROSE.** A key set alone does not close it: a whole
 *      document fits inside a field named `summary`. Every free-text field
 *      carries a ceiling, the citation list carries a count, and the report's
 *      whole canonical size is checked against a bound COMPUTED from those parts
 *      rather than typed — so a key added here tomorrow widens the arithmetic
 *      instead of escaping it.
 *
 * What that pair CANNOT see, stated plainly because the next reader needs it:
 * it cannot tell a truthful 400-character summary from a fabricated one, and it
 * cannot stop a sub-session splitting a document across many runs. It closes the
 * SHAPE, which is what "returns documents" means as a contract; it is not a
 * truthfulness check and nothing here should be read as one.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY AN ABSENCE IS NOT REQUIRED TO CITE ANYTHING
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * "A REPORT with a citation" is the contract for a report that FOUND something.
 * D-129's vocabulary makes four other claims possible, and only `PRESENT` and
 * `partial` are claims that something is there. An absence has nothing to cite,
 * and requiring a citation from it would be `CLAUDE.md`'s own named bug: *"a gate
 * that pressures someone into inventing one is a bug in the gate."* A
 * `LOOKED_ABSENT` report that cited a document to prove the document was not
 * there is precisely the invented attribution the record's rules exist to refuse.
 *
 * What IS required of every report that looked is an OBSERVATION ADDRESS
 * (`observed_at`) — where in the run's own log the search that establishes this
 * claim was written. That is not a citation of evidence; it is what makes the
 * claim CHECKABLE by someone who was not there, which is §11's whole argument for
 * the log, and PL-3 refuses §9's `level-empty` kind without it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * D-164, AND WHY A CITATION HAS EXACTLY ONE FIELD
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * §14b.2 declares the precondition rather than discovering it: legs are
 * DOCUMENT-GRAIN today, *"versions compose document-grain legs, the passage lives
 * in the version's description, and the record cannot yet cite the sentence."*
 * So a citation here is an ADDRESS and nothing else. An `extent` field would be a
 * field for a grain the record cannot express — a shape that reads as coverage
 * and carries none, which is the false-coverage hazard this project keeps
 * meeting. The passage goes in `summary`, exactly where §14b.2 puts it, and when
 * D-164 lands the extent belongs on the LEG and arrives here as a second field
 * with a suite behind it rather than as a hole somebody filled in.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NO DEC-49 FAMILY IS OWED HERE, and it is the same decision `index.mjs` records
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * DEC-49's reach is "every code a SURFACE can receive". No member receives these:
 * this Worker has no member-facing surface and its only caller is the plane, and
 * `civicos-ui/check-refusal-codes.mjs` walks `bio-plane/src` and `checks` rather
 * than the fleet. The convention — a code as a STRING LITERAL at its site through
 * a helper named `refusal` — is followed anyway, because it costs nothing and it
 * is what gives the guard teeth the day it is pointed here.
