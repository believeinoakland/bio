/* R66, R67, R81–R84 — `POST /signin`: THE RELAY OF A MEMBER'S OWN CLAUDE SIGN-IN TO THAT MEMBER'S OWN RUNNER INSTANCE
 * (N708; DEC-156; K1819, K2134, K2200; T47: N1001, K3060 D10, K1874).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A member connects their own Claude subscription by signing in on Anthropic's own page (DEC-156). The
 * sign-in is Claude Code's own (`claude setup-token` since T47, `agent-runner` R27), run unmodified in that member's own
 * `agent-runner` container instance. The plane's door routes `subscriptionsignin` here (`control-plane`) with the member
 * it stamped (`by`, never a value of the member's choosing) and one step: `start` (the binary's sign-in begins, and its
 * sign-in address comes back with the attempt's id), `code` (the code Anthropic's page showed the member, delivered to
 * that sign-in; the binary's token comes back once, R81), `state` (whether an attempt waits) or `signout` (any waiting
 * attempt ends). This member sends the step to the `RUNNER` instance named by the member, and no other, and answers the
 * runner's answer unchanged but for `trace` (R43, R84).
 *
 * THE TOKEN (R81; K3060 D10). Since T47 the token the binary mints is held by `credentials`, not on the container's disk:
 * a `code` answer carries it, and this member relays it only when the door's request states `hold: true` (the door's
 * statement that it hands the token to `credentials` and keeps it from the member's browser). Without that statement the
 * token and its `valid_for` are removed and the answer says `held: false`, so no token reaches a browser through a door
 * that does not hold it. It exists here only between reading the runner's body and writing the answer.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. It holds nothing of the sign-in (R36, R67): the code is read from this request's body only, sent only
 * in the body of the one request to that member's own instance, and never logged, stored, echoed or put in an answer;
 * the sign-in address reaches no answer but the `start` answer the runner gives. It makes no plane call and needs no
 * `PLANE` binding. Which member is connected is `credentials`', told by the door; this member records nothing.
 *
 * WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT ITSELF (R83, R84). Each request writes exactly one JSON line, `signin.worker`, of named non-secret
 * fields only, joined to the door's and the runner's lines by `trace` (the door's `x-civicsmith-trace`, else minted
 * here) and `member_ref` (the door's `x-civicsmith-member-ref`, never the bare member id); both headers are passed on
 * to the runner. Every answer carries `trace`, and every refusal this member makes carries a `detail` written for the
 * member in DEC-149's words (R64). */
