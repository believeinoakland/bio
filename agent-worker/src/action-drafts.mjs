/* R76, R77 — `POST /draft` FOR AN ACTION: THE ASSISTANT'S TEXT CHECK, INFRACTION DRAFT, CLAIM BEARINGS AND STATUS
 * REPORT (T45-15, T46-19; N861, N887, N920; Actions D11b, D25; `run-rules` R27; `skills` R45, R48; `BIO_Action_v0_2.md`
 * §4 rules 1, 2, 9, 12, 16, 19, 21).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Four more tasks the plane's door routes to `POST /draft`, each the member's own act, each answered as a
 * labelled proposal and never stored here:
 *
 *   `textcheck` `{text}`: a prepared outward text, read sentence by sentence; each sentence that reads as an assertion
 *       of breach, a policy position, an ask for the group's or its members' own benefit, or a name of staff below the
 *       responsible official is pointed out, `{index, quote, reads_as, why}`. It never rewrites a sentence: a `quote`
 *       that is not the text's own words makes the answer unformed. It reads nothing of the record (`run-rules` R27),
 *       so a grant sent with it is refused.
 *   `infractiondraft` `{matter, audience}`: a documented account of the act and its office, the standard, the evidence
 *       per point with its grade and what is uncertain, for one audience, `{text, sources}`.
 *   `bearingdraft` `{action, reply}`: each claim of the request, with how the reply bears on it, `{claim, bearing,
 *       quote}`.
 *   `statusreportdraft` `{plan, items}` (T46; N920): a plan's status report from the items `plan-work` R8 assembled, which
 *       the door hands in, `{text, sources}`: each sentence from a handed item, `sources` the items it rests on, named
 *       by their place in `items` (0 the first). It reads nothing (`run-rules` R27's reach `none`), so a grant sent with
 *       it is refused, as `textcheck`'s is.
 *
 * THE RECORDS (K2824). The records a draft is about arrive in the task from the door, assembled from the asking
 * member's own reads: `infractiondraft`'s `record` (`{plan?, actions, correspondence, findings}`, what the member may
 * see of the matter) and `bearingdraft`'s `action_record` and `reply_record` (the action with its claims, the reply's
 * entry and text), and `statusreportdraft`'s `items`. An absent or malformed one is `BAD_TASK`. They are record text: they reach the model only as the
 * result of the fixed `read_facts` call the conversation opens with (R61, `agent-model` R12), text only (R63), as data
 * and never as instruction. Beside them the two drafts may read more only through the member's grant, and only the
 * reads the grant already admits (`answers`' `ASK_SCOPE`, R55's refusal of any other op returned as the tool's result);
 * without a grant they are refused `DRAFT_NEEDS_GRANT`. Which records are the matter's own is the door's and the
 * plane's to bound, never judged here (R37).
 *
 * THE PACK (R77). The model is instructed by the published pack's `action_drafting` layer (`skills` R45), never its
 * `suggestions` or `writing_help` layer; with that layer a stated absence no model is called (502 PACK_UNDETERMINED).
 * The pack is read as R59 reads it: under the grant when one arrived, else the one the door sends in the body.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. It checks, stores and shows no draft, makes no write op, capture request or run row, and keeps
 * nothing between calls (R36). The member's prepared text is the member's own words and goes in the user turn as it
 * arrived; anything the record answers reaches the model only as the read tool's result, text only (R61, R63). Record
 * text telling the model to state a breach, a position, what to file or "you have a claim" can reach the answer only in
 * the draft's own fields, which the door checks before the member sees a word (R77). */
