# Interface change proposals

Created 2026-08-01, on the first change to a STABLE interface. `PARALLELISM.md` said
this file would be written when it was first needed and not before, on the reasoning
that writing a protocol before anyone has felt it gets it wrong. This is that moment.

**Append only. States are appended, never edited in place**, so the history of a
contract reads the way the record's own history does. That is deliberate: this
project's thesis is that append-only history is what makes a claim checkable later,
and its own development process is not exempt.

## The protocol, from `PARALLELISM.md`

1. **PROPOSED.** The proposer states the interface, the change, why, and which
   consumers it believes are affected.
2. **RESPONSES.** Every area listed as a consumer in `INTERFACES.md` answers exactly
   one of `AGREE`, `COUNTER` (with the counter-proposal), or `NOT-AFFECTED`. Silence
   is NOT consent.
3. **RESOLUTION.** All agreed → `ACCEPTED`. Any counter → the proposer amends or
   CONDUCT adjudicates. **If a consumer area is dormant and cannot answer, CONDUCT
   answers on its behalf, IN WRITING, naming that it did so** — recorded as CONDUCT
   answering FOR that area, never as the area agreeing.
4. **CHANGING.** The interface is marked unusable for NEW work in the registry, with
   the date. Existing code keeps working; nothing new is built against either shape.
5. **CHANGED.** The owner lands the change and bumps the interface version.
6. **SETTLED.** Consumers confirm they have migrated, or record that they had nothing
   to migrate. Only then does the registry return to stable.

**When this file is required**, recorded so a session does not re-reason it: a change
to an interface whose status is **STABLE**, or to a PROVISIONAL one that has acquired
a **live consumer**. A provisional interface with no consumer is revised producer-side
with its reasoning, as I2 0.1.0 was.

## IC-1 · I2 element reference: generalise `source` beyond PDF · PROPOSED

- **Interface:** I2 (content → framework), currently **1.0.0 STABLE**
- **Proposer:** session BOB, 2026-08-01, from D-123 / `OFFICE-FORMATS.md`
- **Owner to land it:** `FRAMEWORK`
- **Consumers to answer:** `FRAMEWORK` (owner and consumer — and, as of FW-1 on
  2026-07-31, no longer dormant)
- **Producers affected:** `CONTENT-PDF` (live), `CONTENT-HTML` (dormant), and whoever
  builds the office-format entries (D-121)

### The change

`source` is PDF-shaped: `{ page, rect } | null`. Office formats need references their
own containers can express, and two of them are better than PDF's:

```
source: { kind: "pdf-page"    , ref: "p.7"        , page: 6, rect: [x0,y0,x1,y1] }
      | { kind: "sheet-cell"  , ref: "Sheet1!B14" , sheet: "Sheet1", cell: "B14" }
      | { kind: "slide-shape" , ref: "slide 7"    , slide: 7, shape: 3 }
      | { kind: "dom"         , ref: "<selector>" , selector: "…" }
      | null
```

`pdf-page` keeps `page` and `rect` byte-for-byte as 1.0.0 emits them; the producer adds
two fields and changes nothing else.

### Why, and why it is NOT safely additive

**A required `kind` discriminator is the load-bearing part.** A consumer written
`if (source) usePage(source.page)` does not fail loudly on a sheet-cell source — it
reads `undefined` and carries on. That is a silent misread, which is why this is a
protocol case rather than an additive field: consumers must discriminate, and a
required tag converts the silent failure into an obvious one.

**A required `ref` is the human-readable form, produced by the container that knows
it.** `Sheet1!B14` is already the string a person recognises and a citation surface
will display. Deriving it in the viewer would put per-container knowledge in the wrong
layer, where it drifts — exactly as the UI's hand-composed query syntax drifted from
`op=searchfields`.

**Two designs were considered and rejected**, on opposite sides of the same argument.
A pure STRING (`"Sheet1!B14"` alone) pushes per-container PARSING onto every consumer,
and parsing is where silent misreads live. A pure STRUCTURE with no `ref` forces every
display surface to rebuild the human form per container. Carrying both is the shape
that keeps parsing at the producer and display honest.

### What this does not settle

M4 brings readings and the entity axis (D-71, D-83), and an element reference may want
to BE the same construct as an entity locator rather than a sibling of it. This
proposal does not foreclose that: `kind` + `ref` is the minimal shape an entity locator
would also need — what kind of pointer, and how to show it — so subsuming it later
costs a `kind`, not another break. FRAMEWORK is better placed than the proposer to say
whether it wants to go further NOW rather than twice.

### Status

**PROPOSED, 2026-08-01.** Awaiting FRAMEWORK's response. Nothing is built against
either shape until this resolves; D-121's office-format work can proceed through steps
1 and 2 (the FORMAT registry and the container reader), neither of which emits a
`source`.

### AMENDED 2026-08-03 by the proposer (session BOB) — the DOCX kind was omitted

The union as PROPOSED enumerates `pdf-page` / `sheet-cell` / `slide-shape` / `dom`,
while `OFFICE-FORMATS.md`'s own part-map table names a DOCX element reference —
paragraph / run index — that has no kind. Without one, the DOCX entry (COFF-4) must
either emit `source: null`, discarding citability finer than the whole document, or
invent an unregistered shape — the silent-misread hazard the tagged union exists to
prevent. One arm is added; nothing else changes:

    | { kind: "doc-para", ref: "¶142", para: 141, run: 2 }

- **`para`** — 0-based index into the body's `<w:p>` sequence, REQUIRED. A DOCX
  contains no pages: pagination is computed at render time by the layout engine and
  shifts with fonts and printer metrics, so citing a "page" of a DOCX would claim
  something the captured bytes do not say. The paragraph sequence IS in the bytes,
  and every reference is anchored to a capture sha, so the index is stable for
  exactly as long as the citation is meaningful.
- **`ref`** — the human-readable form, `¶<1-based para>`, REQUIRED per this
  proposal's own rule.
- **`run`** — 0-based run index within the paragraph, OPTIONAL: present when the
  reference genuinely targets runs (a hyperlink, a tracked change), absent when the
  paragraph is the honest granularity. Run boundaries are producer artifacts (Word
  splits runs on formatting and even spell-check state), so the paragraph is what a
  person is shown and the run only sharpens it within one capture — it is never
  presented as structure the author meant.

Still PROPOSED; the response owed is unchanged (FRAMEWORK answers, or CONDUCT answers
on its behalf in writing, naming that it did so). The 2026-08-03 BOB INBOX entry asks
CONDUCT to resolve this, since three format entries (COFF-3/4/5) build against the
resolved union.
