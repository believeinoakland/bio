# The process principles

**Status** · APPROVED by Bob 2026-09-25, as written by BOB #36 from his direction in BOB's session that day. These principles REPLACE the current process wholly; nothing in the old process survives unless it is derived from them. They belong in the process's own repository once it exists (P2). Until then they sit here. The restore point before the replacement is the branch `snapshot/pre-refactor-2026-09-25` (5b9c2643): its tree is `main` @ 95fe7bc7, and its parents are every branch tip of that moment, all kept reachable. Tags could not be pushed from the cloud (HTTP 403).

**P1 · Purpose.** The process exists to put correct, working product behaviour that meets every defined requirement onto `main`. Nothing else is output. A rule, a record or a test has value only as far as it serves that.

**P2 · The process and the product are separate.** Each has its own correctness. The process is defined in its own repository. It keeps the product's **build state** in one subtree of the product repository, and only the process writes there. The build state holds the architecture (layers, modules, their order and dependencies), each module's requirements, the plans, and the record of jobs.

**P3 · The process is correct before it is used.** A meaningful flaw in the process stops all product work until the process is fixed and **certified**: the fix is checked against these principles, then proven on a small dry-run tranche. The process is never patched in reaction while it runs.

**P4 · The architecture is owned by BOB, with Bob.** BOB, working with Bob, defines the layers and the modules. Only BOB, with Bob, adds, removes or reorders them. The modules are arranged in one **total order**. Each module belongs to exactly one layer. A layer's modules are adjacent in the order, and every lower layer's modules come before every higher layer's. A module may use the services of modules earlier in the order, and never of a module later in it. That is acyclic by construction. The declared use is checked against the actual imports, and a violation fails the build.

**P5 · Requirements are owned by BOB, with Bob.** BOB, working with Bob, writes each module's requirements:
- the services the module **provides**: each interface and its behaviour;
- the services it **uses**, named by module;
- the invariants it keeps;
- the product requirements and design sections it satisfies, cited by section.

Requirements may suggest an implementation but never require one. The module is free to choose and change its implementation. Because requirements are read whole, never scanned, they are concise and unambiguous. Only BOB, with Bob, changes a module's requirements. BOB communicates a change to a requirement, or to the interface of a provided service, to every module that uses that service.

**P6 · A module fits in one reading.** A module is sized so that one session can read, in full, its code, its requirements, and the requirements of the services it uses.

**P7 · Only module jobs change module code, and every requirement is proven met.** Every change to a module meets all of that module's requirements as they stand at that moment. **Every requirement is tested, and the tests confirm the module is fully compliant with it.** No requirement goes untested, and no test merely samples one. The tests check behaviour at the module's interface, never its source text. When a module, or a user of a module, finds an ambiguity in the definition of a service, BOB updates the requirements to remove it and to state the service as it now is. The module's tests then confirm compliance with the clarified text.

**P8 · The unit of work is the module job.** A module has at most one job at a time. A job applies every plan entry for its module. Flaws and improvements are both reasons to change a module. When the job finds either in its own module (a requirement not met, an inefficiency, a gap or error in its tests, a better way to meet a requirement, or anything else), **it deals with it in the job whenever possible**. It adds an entry to the next tranche only when it must.

**P9 · A flaw or improvement in another module goes through BOB.** A job that believes it has found a flaw in another module, or an improvement to it, reports it to BOB, described in terms of that module's requirements or its efficiency. BOB confirms it, then:
- if that module's job is running, BOB forwards it to that job, which deals with it in the job whenever possible and adds an entry to the next tranche only when it must, depending on its complexity and how far the job has gone;
- if no job is running for that module, BOB adds an entry to the next tranche.

A flaw in the requirements themselves goes to BOB and Bob.

**P10 · Builds happen in tranches.** A tranche's plan is fixed when the tranche starts. Its jobs run in module order: lowest layer first, and in order within a layer. An entry that arises during a tranche goes to the **next** plan. The one exception is a change to a provided service. BOB carries it to the modules that use the service, and those modules come later in the order, so their jobs in this tranche pick it up. When every job of a tranche is merged, its plan is archived and the next plan becomes current.

**P11 · Tests follow the architecture.** Each module has its own tests, and each layer may have layer tests. A job runs its module's tests and its layer's tests. When it changes what its module provides, it also runs the tests of every module that uses the change. **Because every job in a layer may run that layer's tests, testing lives in module tests wherever possible, and the effort needed to run layer tests is kept as small as possible.** The full regression runs only at release, or when Bob asks.

**P12 · Done means merged.** A job is done when its tests pass and it is merged to `main`. A tranche is done when every one of its jobs is merged.

**P13 · Sessions are short and single-purpose.** A session does one job, or one planning step, and ends. State lives in the build state, never in a long-running context. A session's cost grows with its context size multiplied by its number of turns: re-reading its own context is most of what it spends. A long-lived session woken again and again is the most expensive thing the process can run.

**P14 · Usage is measured first, then bounded.**
- **The authoritative measure** is Bob's plan meter: the share of the weekly limit used, as Bob reads it.
- **The process measures TOKENS PROCESSED per session** (cache reads plus cache writes plus input plus output), tagged by tranche and job, and recorded by each session before it ends. It never uses dollar estimates, which understate and are unreliable across container restarts.
- **The first tranches COLLECT METRICS; they are not bounded by them.** Token counts per job are recorded alongside job size (the module's lines, its entries, its test runs, its session turns) and against the movement of Bob's weekly meter, to build an empirical model of what a job costs.
- **Real budget bounds are set only once that model exists**, and Bob approves them. Until then Bob sees each tranche's measured usage when it ends.

**P15 · A ruling is made once, and recorded unambiguously yet concisely.** A decision is recorded once, in its home document, stated unambiguously and as concisely as possible, so that every later session that reads it spends as little context as possible. It is not reopened without new evidence named in writing.

**P16 · Rules derive from principles.** Every process rule names the principle it serves. A rule is never added in reaction to an incident unless it can be derived from a principle. These principles change only with Bob's approval.
