# The UX substrate

What a member sees and works with, as the approved requirements and Bob's rulings define it, for Bob's UX redesign. The page opens with the decisions still Bob's to make, each with a brief (background, what is already fixed, the choices, a recommendation and ways to answer), then states what is settled as it now stands.

- `ux-substrate-v2.json`: the inventory (constructs with their acts and act weights, relationships, roles, display primitives, what is decided but not yet built, where canon and requirements disagree, old-interface divergence, working names, glossary, screens, and Bob's other rulings that shape what members see).
- `ux-experience.json`: audiences, use cases, step-by-step experience, screen rules, and the open questions (numbered; each open one carries a `brief`, each settled one a `ruled` entry stating the design as it stands).
- `build_ux2.py`: renders both into `ux-substrate.html` (run `python3 docs/development/ux-substrate/build_ux2.py` from the repository root). Published at https://claude.ai/artifact/JsPZAftab91EL9Ut91qWGx with `views/` beside it.
- `views/`: the Action design's screen sketches (`build/plan/action-design/*.html`), each with a document head so they publish beside the page; `plan-page.html` is approved (K608 (4)).
- `design-principles.html`: step 1 of the design phase (Bob, 2026-10-02): every ruled UX principle stated once, with the gaps for Bob to rule. Published at https://claude.ai/artifact/MvsMPnJnk3o32FBeqgdxT1.
- `brand-and-voice.html`: step 2 of the design phase (draft, 2026-10-03): who speaks, how the names are written, CivicOS's voice and tone, words, and questions V1–V4.
- `HANDOFF.md`: the design session's handoff to its successor (who you are, how to record a ruling, where the design phase stands, the pages and their URLs). Rewritten 2026-10-03.
- `measures-map.html`: the approved measures map DEC-82 rests on (rendered at https://claude.ai/artifact/TfqcXNaJQ86SZzUA8Xn6Ni).
- `ux-substrate.json`, `build_ux.py`: the first inventory and its renderer, kept for reference.

**As of** `main` @ `c1a27e41a5` (T11–T19 built; the Action layer built at the plane, with no member screens yet); Bob's rulings DEC-1–DEC-95 and K-rulings to K859. The open-question briefs were checked against the same commit. The requirements (`build/requirements/`) win over this snapshot. When Bob closes a question the page lists, the page is updated in the same change that records the ruling (K438).

## Working alongside the development process

Bob runs two streams of work under two accounts, and neither can reach the other's sessions; they meet only in this repository.

- **The development process** (ROOT, BOB, module jobs, tranches) runs on Bob's **secondary account** (ROOT #3 onward, K742). BOB owns `build/` (requirements, plans, `build/rulings.md`, `next.md`) and records there the answers Bob gives it, as K-rulings; some of those settle UX questions (for example K899 (1) on "record", K903 (4) on hidden dependents).
- **The UX design session** and its successors run on Bob's **primary account** (this page's session: `session_01EhPoUTrVCgAqw2ktRyKjCU`). It owns this folder and records Bob's UX rulings in `docs/development/DECISIONS.md` (DEC entries, each naming the session and account in its `raised:` line), folds each into the canon document it changes, and updates and republishes this page in the same change.

**The channel between them (PROCESS-MECHANICS §13.1, proposed by BOB #87 and approved by Bob, 2026-10-01).** Each side writes an append-only outbox on its own dedicated mail branch, which never merges into `main`: BOB on `mail/BOB` (`mail/BOB.md`), the design session on `mail/UX-DESIGN` (`mail/UX-DESIGN.md`); the registry of participants is `build/channels.md` on `main`. An outbox starts with a **Writer** line (name, session id, account, since) that a successor rewrites at takeover, carries one **Read** cursor per correspondent, and holds numbered entries (`U1`, `U2`… for the design session, `B1`… for BOB) of kinds NOTICE, QUESTION, ANSWER, DEFER, HANDOFF, MERGE and ACK, posted with `tools/mail.mjs` (`xpost`, `xinbox`, `xdone`, `xcheck`, `xwriter`) from the design session's own clone of `civicos-process`. There is no doorbell across accounts: each side reads the other's outbox at takeover, at each backstop or check-in, before recording any ruling of Bob's, and whenever Bob says "check the channel".

**How the design session records, so the two never collide or contradict:**

1. Before recording a ruling, read BOB's outbox past the cursor and fetch `main` for K-rulings and DEC entries added since the last look. A ruling Bob made through the development process may settle or change the question; if so, the page cites it and says it was made there, and no second, possibly conflicting, ruling is recorded.
2. DEC numbers are the design session's: the next free number across `main` and its own open branch, each announced in a NOTICE. If `main` gains the same number first, the branch renumbers (K473's practice), never `main`. K numbers are BOB's alone.
3. The design session never writes `build/` (save its registry row through its PR); BOB never edits `docs/development/ux-substrate/` or `docs/development/DECISIONS.md`, and keeps the design session's text in any merge conflict (K945). A DEC's owed work reaches BOB as a HANDOFF; BOB folds it once the DEC is on `main` and answers with the K that folds it.
4. The branch merges `main` in often and keeps its pull request mergeable; BOB merges it at a tranche's close.
5. Questions the development process defers to the design session (for example retraction of a published case, deferred from T21 on 1 October, question 36) arrive as DEFER entries and are taken up here as briefs on this page.
