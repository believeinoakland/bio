# The backlog's tail — the same order, continued

`docs/development/BACKLOG.md` holds the head of the order, within its budget; this file holds the REST of the same
order, and its first row comes directly after `BACKLOG.md`'s last (`docs/development/WORK-PIPELINE.md` §2). It is
LOOKED UP, never read whole: find any row with `node tools/ledger.mjs find <ID>`. Rows arrive and leave only by
tool: a placement that puts `BACKLOG.md` over its budget moves whole rows from its foot to the head of this file,
and a refill or any later write moves them back as room frees (`tools/ledger.mjs` `planRebalance`). No row is
ever cut to fit. No whole-file budget; a row is held to 2 KiB, as in the backlog.

### M0-44 · queued — FLIPPED TO `running` AND REVERTED WITHIN THE HOUR, 2026-09-17, by CONDUCT #1, and the reversal is recorded rather than silently undone.
order: M0; seven truncated claims invisible to the bounds instrument (SCHEDULER, 2026-09-18, re-ordered at the lift of the M0 hold)
milestone: M0 (background lane, holds no slot)
interface: none — a reader's pattern and the rosters derived from it; no plane source moves
design: `docs/development/VERIFICATION.md` — the test estate's own authority, admitted for the M0 lane BY … (whole text: the cut archive)
depends-on: none (M0-38 landed the grading and pinned the blind spot rather than fixing it)

depends-on: none (M0-29 landed the sweep and its adjudication table)
accepts-when: the census reports the sweep's tally section (0 open candidates on the estate as landed, the three retired instances listed as adjudicated); one unadjudicated candidate … (whole text: the cut archive)
cut: cut to its fields (LED-6 step (3), SCHEDULER, 2026-09-19) and again by SCHEDULER #9 (2026-09-21, the backlog's 150 KiB budget); the row as it stood before this cut is VERBATIM under «M0-33» in `docs/archive/ledgers/QUEUE-cut-2026-09-21.md`. A worker READS IT before building.
