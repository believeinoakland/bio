# The backlog's tail — the same order, continued

`docs/development/BACKLOG.md` holds the head of the order, within its budget; this file holds the REST of the same
order, and its first row comes directly after `BACKLOG.md`'s last (`docs/development/WORK-PIPELINE.md` §2). It is
LOOKED UP, never read whole: find any row with `node tools/ledger.mjs find <ID>`. Rows arrive and leave only by
tool: a placement that puts `BACKLOG.md` over its budget moves whole rows from its foot to the head of this file,
and a refill or any later write moves them back as room frees (`tools/ledger.mjs` `planRebalance`). No row is
ever cut to fit. No whole-file budget; a row is held to 2 KiB, as in the backlog.
