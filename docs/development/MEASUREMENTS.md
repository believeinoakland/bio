# Measurements

Every number this project's limits and defaults rest on, with the date and the
instrument. Kept in one place because the alternative is what happened before it
existed: a cap of 40 written from a guess, a comment claiming "50 on this
account" that was a guess about somebody else's infrastructure, and a CPU worry
based on a documented figure that turned out not to be what was enforced.

**The rule this file exists to enforce: a number in the source that nobody
measured is a guess wearing a constant's clothes.** If a value here goes stale,
re-run the instrument named beside it rather than reasoning about it.

All figures below are from the deployed plane on biosmoke7 (Workers **Free**,
account `20b533579290b9b93168345edd3b7f72`) unless stated otherwise. Measured
against plane 0.36.0 through 0.45.0 on 2026-07-29; a later session has shipped
UI work on top of these releases without changing the plane figures.

## Runtime limits

| What | Measured | How | Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| External subrequests per invocation | **51** including the primary fetch | `op=acquire` hit it; recorded by calibration as `capture_limits` | 2026-07-29 |
| Cloudflare-service subrequests | not hit; documented as 1,000 | R2 and Durable Object calls draw on a separate budget, which is why calibration reads 51 while the code counts 42 fetches | 2026-07-29 |
| CPU | **40,000,000 reference iterations fit**; killed during the next 2,000,000 | `op=cpuprobe`, 20 steps completed, HTTP 503 `error code: 1102`, checkpoint trail intact | 2026-07-29 |

The CPU line is the one to read carefully. The documented Workers Free figure is
10ms of CPU per invocation, and forty million modular multiplications is not 10ms
of anything. **What is enforced on this account is not the documented number.**
That is the entire argument for this file.

**A Worker cannot time itself.** Cloudflare freezes `Date.now()` during
synchronous execution as a timing-attack defence, so a first attempt to measure
per-segment compute reported zero for every segment of every real capture. Any
millisecond figure produced inside a Worker is a fabrication. Consumption is
counted in work; the ceiling is measured in reference iterations. See
`bio-plane/src/cpu.mjs`.

## What real pages cost

Captured through the deployed plane with `subresources: true`.

| Page | Subresources discovered | Links | Compute calls | Bytes worked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `www.acgov.org/` | 54 | — | 42 | 1.96 MB |
| `oakland.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx` | 309 | 116 | 42 | 1.96 MB |
| `oaklandside.org/` | 566 | 128 | 49 | 16.97 MB |
| `oaklandca.opengov.com/` | 142 | **0** | — | — |

**The original cap of 40 truncated every one of these**, including the 54-item
page, which needed one more fetch than it had. A capture rendered from 39 of 634
parts is a capture of a fraction of a page.

**OpenGov's zero is not an error.** It serves a JS-rendered shell with no anchors
in its HTML. See `CLIENT-RENDERED.md`.

## What the policy removes, and what it does not

Measured on the same pages after 0.37.0 and 0.40.0.

| Page | Collapsed srcset | Third-party | Furniture | Reused from the host record |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `oaklandside.org/` | **383 of 566** | 12 | 8 | 30 on a later pass |
| `oakland.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx` | 0 | 4 | **0** | 51 by the fifth pass |
| `www.acgov.org/` | 0 | 3 | 2 | — |

**srcset collapse does the heavy lifting**: two thirds of a news front page's
references were duplicate renditions of the same pictures.

**Structural furniture detection barely fires on the sites that matter**: zero on
Legistar, two on acgov. Municipal sites write `<div class="nav">`, not `<nav>`.
The mechanism is correct on well-structured HTML and finds almost nothing on
legacy CMSes, which is why recurrence-based detection across a host exists.

## Convergence: what reuse and continuation buy

Five successive passes over two Legistar pages, each pass costing the same
subrequest budget.

```
pass 1  Calendar     fetched 42  reused  0  outstanding 232
pass 3  Calendar     fetched 69  reused 31  outstanding 168
pass 5  Calendar     fetched 89  reused 51  outstanding 118
pass 5  Legislation  fetched 80  reused 60  outstanding   0   COMPLETE
```

A heavy first capture, driven across ticks by continuation on a page with no
prior host record:

```
oaklandside.org  tick 1  fetched  75  reused 30  outstanding 72
                 tick 2  fetched 120  reused  0  outstanding 26
                 tick 3  fetched 146  reused  0  outstanding  0   COMPLETE
```

Reuse needs **two distinct documents** on a host before an asset counts as the
site's, so it does nothing until the third capture of a host. That is by design
and it is why pass 1 and pass 2 show zero.

## Link partitions on real pages

| Page | Links | anchor | deferred | refused | resolving to a held capture | naming an element |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `oaklandside.org/` | 128 | 1 | 126 | 0 | 1 | — |
| `oakland.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx` | 116 | 27 | 81 | 6 | 2 | 26 |

**Every resolved verdict came back `undetermined`**, which is the shape the
design predicted and the reason the verdict is three-valued rather than boolean.

**One resource on the Legistar calendar was cited 28 different ways.** Under the
pre-0.43.0 key, which dropped the fragment, those 28 citations were one row.

## Source access

See `SOURCE-ACCESS.md` for the full picture. In short: `www.oaklandca.gov`
returns 403 to the plane on every path including `robots.txt`, while
`data.oaklandca.gov`, `oaklandca.opengov.com`, `oakland.legistar.com`,
`oaklandside.org` and `www.acgov.org` all answer normally.

## Instruments

- `op=runtime` — measured work, the CPU probe trail, and the subrequest ceiling
- `op=cpuprobe` — walks into the CPU ceiling, checkpointing durably per step
- `op=acquire` with `subresources: true` — every per-page figure above
- `op=links&capture=<sha>` — link partitions and verdicts

## User-agent admission at www.oaklandca.gov

Measured **2026-07-30**, thread CAPTURE. Instrument: `curl` from Anthropic
container egress against
`/Government/Finance-Budget/Financial-Reporting/Annual-Comprehensive-Financial-Reports`,
varying ONLY the `User-Agent` header. Eight consecutive requests per string, all
eight identical every time. Verdicts re-confirmed on a second unrelated path, so
the result follows the agent and not the URL.

| User-agent | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `CivicOS/0.46.0 (+https://…; instance biosmoke7; acquire)` | **200** |
| `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Google-Apps-Script; beanserver; …)` | 200 |
| `curl/8.x`, `Wget/1.21.4`, `python-requests/2.31.0` | 200 |
| `bio-acquire`, `bio-monitor` (what the plane sent) | **403** |
| no user-agent header at all | 403 |
| `archive.org_bot`, `ia_archiver` | 403 |
| `Googlebot`, `Bingbot`, `GPTBot` | 403 |

**The discriminator is the user-agent, not the source address.** One network
produced both outcomes. The `server-timing: ak_p` header identifies Akamai, so
this is Akamai Bot Manager. Some unrecognised tokens pass (`xyzzy-fetch`,
`biofetch`) and others do not (`foobarbaz`, `wombat`); that is Akamai's internal
scoring and **no rule for it was established**.

Full narrative, including the robots.txt findings, in `SOURCE-ACCESS.md`.

## Live instance census, biosmoke7

Read **2026-07-30** via `op=list` and `op=file` with a read-only member token.

**31 bundles**, not 30: 8 `verified`, 1 `elevated` (`PROB-2026-0001`), 1
`forming` (`PROJ-2026-0001`), the rest `collected`.

Primary source hosts across 28 readable provenance documents (archive.org
locators excluded):

| Count | Host |
| --- | --- |
| 6 | `www.oaklandca.gov` |
| 5 | `oakland.legistar1.com` |
| 4 | `webapi.legistar.com` |
| 2 | `oaklandca.opengov.com` |
| 2 | `cao-94612.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com` |
| 1 each | `oakland.legistar.com`, `www.oaklandauditor.com`, `data.oaklandca.gov`, `scocal.stanford.edu` |

The six `www.oaklandca.gov` bundles were all retrieved **2026-07-19** by the
Apps Script data plane, method `daemon-fetch`, each carrying an RFC3161 timestamp
token from `freetsa.org`. Every one also carries a `save-page-now` attestation
attempt and **all of those failed** (four HTTP 302, one 520).

## Chosen constants, ours and not measured

Recorded here so they are visibly chosen and revisable rather than mistaken for
findings.

| Value | Setting | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Archive fallback threshold | 3 consecutive direct failures, or 14 days | see `AUTHORITY-AND-TRUST.md` |
| Archive request appetite | 24/min | matches the stricter of two third-party figures; ours because it is our appetite |

Third-party rate-limit figures for archive.org, with their sources, are in
`ARCHIVE-FALLBACK.md`. They are **not** measurements of ours.
