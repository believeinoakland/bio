# Starting a BIO session

Claude reads everything it needs from this public repository at the start
of a session, with no credentials: the full source tree and the documents
in docs/. Attach nothing.

Say what to work on. If the session will do any of the following, grant
the matching permission when asked, or up front:

1. SHIP A RELEASE (push code, release files, or docs to this repo):
   paste the GitHub token. It lives in Bob's notes and is long-lived by
   his decision (July 24, 2026): during development the repo holds no
   production instance and nobody else runs BIO, so per-session minting
   was pure friction. Claude cannot carry a secret between sessions, so
   the value has to be pasted once per session; that is a paste, not a
   re-mint. Revisit when a real group installs.

2. TOUCH AN INSTANCE'S DATA (migrate, load, inspect the record from the
   session): paste the MEMBER_TOKEN. Same standing arrangement.

3. INSTALL OR UPDATE AN INSTANCE: no grant needed. The installer at
   newgroup.believeinoakland.workers.dev authenticates through
   Cloudflare's own sign-in with a click.

Release signing is BUILT and ARMED as of 0.4.0. The installer carries
Bob's release public key and refuses any repository release that is not
signed by it, falling back to its own built-in copy and saying so. Bob
signs each release asset in tools/sign-release.html, a local browser
page that never touches the network, and pastes the resulting signature
block into the session. Development keys were generated July 24, 2026
and are disposable; production gets fresh keys, passphrase-protected,
before any real group installs.

The state of the work lives in docs/BIO_DATAPLANE_STATE.md in this
repository. Claude keeps it current with every release.
