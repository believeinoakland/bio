/* THE MEMBER, BOOTED FROM ITS COMMITTED BYTES, IN ONE PLACE.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a `*.test.mjs`: the battery's discovery rule is readdir +
 * `endsWith(".test.mjs")`, and this is a helper two suites share — this member's
 * own suite and the plane's acceptance suite one tree over. Two copies of a
 * boot recipe is how the two come to differ in the one detail that matters.
 *
 * WHAT IT KNOWS THAT A ONE-PART MEMBER'S BOOT DOES NOT: this member is THREE
 * upload parts, and the two that are not JavaScript are the ones its stated
 * fidelity is a measurement of. `modules:true` cannot express that, so the
 * modules array is built by hand — an `ESModule` for the bundle, a
 * `CompiledWasm` for the engine core (Workers forbid runtime wasm compilation;
 * the platform compiles it at upload, and miniflare does the same at boot), and
 * a `Data` part for the language model. The module NAMES are the specifiers the
 * committed bundle imports, which is why `modulesRoot` is the member directory
 * and the parts sit under `assets/`.
 *
 * THE COMMITTED ARTIFACT IS WHAT BOOTS, never the source. That is the property
 * `newgroup` needs and the one FL-9's guard exists to keep true.
