/* THE MEMBER ITSELF — the HTTP surface and the one-page pipeline — in a module
 * that imports NO ENGINE.
 *
 * WHY THE ENGINE IS HANDED IN RATHER THAN IMPORTED. `tessengine.mjs` imports
 * the wasm core and the language model as WORKERS MODULE TYPES (`CompiledWasm`
 * and `Data`), which node cannot resolve, so a module that imports the engine
 * is one a node-side suite cannot load at all. With the engine (and the page
 * renderer) passed to `makeMember`, the suite drives THIS code — the same
 * expressions the worker runs — with a real renderer and a real engine under
 * workerd, and with stand-ins in node where it must reach a step no real page
 * reaches: the renderer never answers a container other than PNG once it is
 * asked to decode DCT, and never writes a PNG its reader refuses, yet R7 orders
 * both refusals and they must hold the day a route changes. `index.mjs` wires
 * the real engine in; nothing else does.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES (CPDF-10, tier 3, the producer side). Given a capture sha, a
 * store namespace and the pages that have no text layer, it reads the captured
 * bytes FROM R2 ITSELF (the `CAPTURES` read binding — never handed the bytes),
 * renders ONE page to pixels through CPDF-12's renderer, runs the engine over
 * that frame, and answers line-grain regions, each carrying the image region a
 * reader can check it against. The contract is the consumer's
 * (`ocrTextFromMember`, `bio-plane/src/index.mjs`): every field below is a field
 * the plane already refuses on.
 *
 * ---- ONE PAGE PER INVOCATION, AND IT IS MEMORY THAT SAYS SO ----------------
 * CPDF-15 (MEASUREMENTS.md, 2026-09-10, on the deployed runtime): RGBA frames of
 * 33.7, 48.5 and 61.3 MB complete; a 75.7 MB frame is KILLED (`exceededMemory`,
 * reproduced). The bound is the workload size that survives, NEVER a share of
 * 128 MB (D-312: the platform's `memoryUsageBytes` reads 132–240 MB on
 * invocations it marks `success`). So a page whose frame would exceed it is
 * REFUSED BY NAME before anything is allocated, and a request naming several
 * pages is CHUNKED, never looped: whole-document invocation is UNMEASURED. The
 * plane loops over `deferred`, one invocation per page (D-606).
 *
 * ---- WHAT THIS MEMBER MAY NOT DO (fleet rules 2/3) -------------------------
 * It writes NOTHING: it holds `CAPTURES` read and no other binding (no STORE,
 * no PUBLISHED), and it calls nothing on `CAPTURES` but `.get`. And it may not
 * make the text look better than it is: no spell-correction, no dictionary
 * pass, no joining of hyphenated lines. It returns what the decoder decoded.

 * suite reads the plane's set and requires the refusal's `namespaces` to equal it. Exact and case-sensitive: an R2
