/* THE ENGINE, AND THE THREE THINGS THAT MAKE IT RUN INSIDE AN ISOLATE AT ALL.
 *
 * Every one of them was found BY BEING REFUSED, on a deployed Worker, by
 * CPDF-15 (MEASUREMENTS.md, 2026-09-10). They are restated here because this is
 * the file where getting one wrong costs the next reader a probe pass:
 *
 *   1. WASM IS AN IMPORTED MODULE, NEVER A COMPILED BUFFER. Workers forbid
 *      runtime wasm compilation and emscripten's default path is
 *      `WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes)`. The core arrives as a module part of
 *      type `application/wasm` — so it IS a `WebAssembly.Module` — and reaches
 *      emscripten through its `instantiateWasm` hook, the only entry point that
 *      does `new WebAssembly.Instance(module, imports)`.
 *   2. `locateFile` MUST BE SUPPLIED. Without it emscripten evaluates
 *      `new URL("tesseract-core.wasm", import.meta.url)` and workerd throws
 *      `TypeError: Invalid URL string.` Supplying it takes the other branch.
 *   3. THE ENGINE WANTS RGBA. `loadImage` refuses anything shorter than
 *      width*height*4, so the frame is not avoidable by sending less. That frame
 *      is this member's binding constraint and `member.mjs` bounds it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT. It is not a place a measured number lives. `cap`,
 * `measured_by` and the confidence floor are the RECORD's, assembled in
 * `member.mjs` from constants that name their measurement; this file
 * produces text, rectangles and the engine's own confidence and judges none of
 * them.
