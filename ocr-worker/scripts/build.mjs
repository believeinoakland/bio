/* Build the ocr-worker into ONE self-contained module, PLUS the two upload parts
 * a wasm member cannot bundle away.
 *
 * The esbuild recipe is NOT written here. It lives in
 * `bio-plane/scripts/fleet-bundle.mjs`, which is also what
 * `bio-plane/test/fleetbundles.test.mjs` builds with when it asserts this
 * committed artifact is byte-identical to a fresh build of its source. One
 * expression of the recipe, or the build and the guard can disagree and the
 * guard is the one that would be wrong.
 *
 * THE PRE-STEP NO OTHER MEMBER HAS, and it is the plane's `embed:sign` shape:
 * `src/tesslib.mjs` is GENERATED from `node_modules/tesseract-wasm/dist/lib.js`
 * by two anchored substitutions (read `scripts/embed-tesslib.mjs` for which
 * measurement refused the alternative in each case). The render is COMMITTED and
 * input-hashed like any other source, and the gate closes the loop the input
 * hashes cannot see — a changed vendor whose render was never re-run — by
 * re-rendering in memory and comparing. Nothing in the gate writes.
 *
 * Run from ocr-worker/: `npm run build`. `--embed-only` regenerates the glue and
 * stops, which is what a vendor bump wants before it rebuilds.
