/* The measurement the first profile's policy series rest on (R67, R69; basis `2026-10-07 policies`): JURISDICTIONS #8 read
 * each family's primary pages on 2026-10-07 and copied here, as printed, the citations of one item of the family and the
 * header labels its documents print. Each family names the pages read. The profile's `cite` and `policy_headers` patterns
 * are tested against these strings (t35.test.mjs); nothing here is product data.
 *
 * Pages: OPD's public PowerDMS site lists 289 documents (`/OAKLAND/documents`, the directory's own API, read whole), in
 * the folders "Department General Orders (DGO)" (173), "Special Orders (SO)" (8, and 2 under "Use of Force"), "Training
 * Bulletins (TB)" (63) and "City Administrative Instructions" (4); one document of each family was read whole as served.
 * OUSD's board-policy portal lists its Board Policies (BP), Administrative Regulations (AR) and Exhibits, numbered as
 * `0420.0` or `5124`; two posts and one published PDF were read whole. The City Auditor's 9-1-1 audit (2025-10-08) names
 * NENA's standards without a designation.
 *
 * K1930 (BOB's CHANGE B4): doctypes captured 50 of the same families' documents from the same PowerDMS addresses the same
 * day (`doctypes/test/fixtures/policies.json`, its R35). Read whole here, they print header labels the first reading did
 * not hold (Ref, Rev., New Order, DATE, Effective Date without its colon, Evaluation Date, SUBJECT/AGENCY), a Special
 * Order's own number as "SPECIAL ORDER NO. 8011", an AI cited as "Administrative Instruction No. 501", and, on 12 General
 * Orders, the CALEA standards each cites ("Ref: CALEA Standards 15.1.1"). Those lines are added below, each with the
 * document that prints it. */
