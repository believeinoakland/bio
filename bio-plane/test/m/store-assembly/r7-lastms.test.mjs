/* store-assembly's copy of plane's test. plane R91 -> R71 (fix round 7, G67; diagnosis-R7-reading.md R1, "What `last_ms` measures"): A ROW'S TIME IS ITS OWN. `started_at` was the alarm's
   instant, the same for every consumer and every row of the tick, so `last_ms` was the clock when the row ended minus the instant the whole
   alarm began: every earlier consumer and light row was in it. The row now starts at its own start; `own_ms` is the part that is the row's own
   (the 10 s bar's, BOB's reading of its own bar) and `wait_ms` the part it spent awaiting a worker (a service binding), reported apart.
   The clock is the injected one (R-CLOCK: no compute time is asserted; a stub advances it). */
