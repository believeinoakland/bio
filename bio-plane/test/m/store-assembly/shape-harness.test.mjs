/* store-assembly's copy of plane's test. plane G123b, G123c (fix round 9; S-39, S-40; K4787): THE SHAPE HARNESS'S OWN TESTS. The harness (`shape/harness.mjs`) runs the real plane in a capped child; what it measures and what it injects must itself be shown.
   R84 names the harness's reads (the cap convention is G123a's test in `g41-shape.test.mjs`). Each test runs a 3 MiB CSV (two ticks, a few seconds) through `shapeRun`:
   G123b  a buffer held inside ONE tick shows in that tick's `peakMB` (the sampler is inside the tick; it was cleared on the next line, so `peakMB` was a tick-boundary reading), a clean tick does not
   G123c  each fault injector acts at the tick it names, through the real object (`injected`), and the control run beside it is untouched: a store that refuses writes, an owner that throws at its entry,
          the evidence object gone, a kill after k statements (a new object over the same storage), a restart, and the poke after the restart; the 2 MB value shim is applied in the suite process.
   Counts only (R-CLOCK): no assertion reads a time. Run under the preload (`npm test`, `module-tests.mjs`): `node --import ./test/platform-sqlite.mjs --test test/m/store-assembly/shape-harness.test.mjs`. */
