/* store-assembly's copy of plane's test. plane G128i, FILES OVER 25,165,824 B (24 MiB) STATED "NOT READ" AGAINST BOB'S TIERS (fix round 9; X29; round 7 G14; corpus R set, K4426 "Still MISSING" row 6): the whole-read ceiling of the alpha is `boundOf("pdf","bytes")`
   (25,165,824 B, reading-pipeline `WHOLE_READ_MAX`), and it is the heavy kinds' alone (PDF, office, image: K4628's tier is 100 MB for a document, the alpha keeps 24 MiB where it is lower and says so, K4831 (3)). The LIGHT kinds (text, CSV,
   TSV, JSON, XML) take the standard from Stage 1 (K4834): `boundOf("text","bytes")` and `boundOf("csv","bytes")` are 50 MB. Through plane's shape runner (the real plane in a child under the one cap convention and the platform's value limit),
   each file uploaded by the member's path and read to its end by the ledger, the figures read from `READ_BOUNDS` by `boundOf` (never a literal here):
     text   25,165,825 B   (one byte over the alpha's whole-read ceiling, under the text tier)   READ WHOLE, the last line found    [round 7's A.md:12 "24 bytes over ... so it was not read"]
     csv    25,165,825 B                                                                         READ WHOLE, the last row found
     pdf    25,165,825 B   (over the heavy kinds' ceiling)    REFUSED, stated with its size and its limit, nothing owed
     text   the text tier + 1   REFUSED, stated with its size and its limit
   Counts only (R-CLOCK). HEAVY: run alone. */
