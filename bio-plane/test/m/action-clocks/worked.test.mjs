/* R2's acceptance tests (T33-74): the 20 worked deadline examples of `build/plan/measures-T33/time-law.md` §3, each
   with its negative control, counted by this module's `computeDeadline` (the count `clockPropose` and `filings` use)
   on the first profile's view, whose sourced lists hold the judicial calendars of 2018, 2020 and 2026, the City's and
   the federal 2026 lists (K1519). The examples whose start is not a ledger event (a hearing, service, accrual) are
   counted from the `sent` entry standing for that event, as `filings` hands its start; O1 and F1–F2 go through
   `clockPropose` on an action. The rules are written as the profile writes them (`jurisdictions` R26), each named for
   its source; a rule the profile holds is read from it. Dates in the comments are the example's own. */
