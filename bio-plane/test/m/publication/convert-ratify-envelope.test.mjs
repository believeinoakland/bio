/* publication — converted from `test/ratify-envelope.test.mjs` (REC-53), publication's share: "R15 a
   `recordcasemanifest` silence answering its op, never `MANIFEST_NOT_RECORDED`". The old suite is not deleted (K619).
   R15 as now worded keeps only the store half here: `recordCaseManifest` records a case edition's manifest once
   (`MALFORMED`, `NO_SUCH_CASE_EDITION`, `MANIFEST_EXISTS`) and is reached through its op. The silence itself (a store
   that never answered read as `STORE_DID_NOT_ANSWER`, never `MANIFEST_NOT_RECORDED`) and "no put" (the published
   bucket written only on an answered `ok`) live in `assembleCaseContainer`, which is `public-read` R6's since K651, so
   they are that module's to prove. What is proved here, at publication's interface: the op answers every body with an
   object naming its own reason (so the Worker's `rec || {reason: "MANIFEST_NOT_RECORDED"}` fallback is never reached
   through an answer of this module), no answer is ever `MANIFEST_NOT_RECORDED`, a refusal writes nothing, and a retry
   writes nothing. `services.test.mjs`' R15 test holds the values recorded; this extends it. */
