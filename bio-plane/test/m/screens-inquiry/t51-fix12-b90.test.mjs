/* screens-inquiry T51 fix round 12 (B90; walks C and E): C-M12 (the contradiction flag fold stays open once another document is chosen, and a pick made
 * before a redraw is drawn as the member left it; DEC-394 3e, R127) and walk E S3 (a cited passage's "Cited" mark sits on its own line, not glued to the passage
 * text; R125, R3). On interface-shell's served page over the real world (K5054): the state is made by real acts, and every expectation is a word read by key (K3810). */
