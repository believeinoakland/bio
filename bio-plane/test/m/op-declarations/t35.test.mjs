/* op-declarations R30, R6, R19 (T35-70; K1901, K1943, K1972, K1976): T35's ops — the archive's, a member's own notes,
   "Find in this", the offices read, the credit page, the security map, sign-out, the recovery codes and `recover`, the
   second-administrator step, the agent's pack apart, a member's subscription disconnected — and the T35 ops of the
