/* CONVERTED (T18, the ratification job): ratification's share of four old suites, as module tests at this module's
   interface. The old suites were not deleted by this job (K619):
     - test/casesign.test.mjs
     - test/d442-publish-writes-nothing.test.mjs
     - test/ratify-authority.test.mjs
     - test/ratify-envelope.test.mjs
   Only ratification's share is converted, as build/jobs/T17/legacy-tests.md's row for each names it ("ratification
   R…"); what those rows give case-authoring, publication, membership and promotion is theirs, not this file's.

   The old suites drove op=publish (case-authoring's) to author the /5 case document the case gate then ran over. This
   file may not import case-authoring, so it writes a document of the same shape BY HAND (`publishedCaseText`, below):
   the lines, keys and body sections `caseDocumentText` writes for a two-member case whose project declared no bar and
   whose basis legs name nothing the record can resolve (casesign's corpus), and parses it with record-grammar's
   `parseFrontmatter`, as the old suites parsed the text op=publish returned. Every other act is driven at the module's
   interface: the store half (`ratificationOf` through the fixture's `world()`), the Worker half (`caseRatifyOp`,
   `ratifyOp` with the fixture's `plane(w)`), and the pure `checkCaseDocument`. */
