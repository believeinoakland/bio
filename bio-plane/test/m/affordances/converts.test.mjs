/* affordances: the shares of three old suites (T18's converts, `build/jobs/T17/legacy-tests.md`), driven in-process at
   this module's interface (`affordanceFacts`, `deriveActs`, `decorate`) over the owning modules' own fixtures, with the
   acts performed at their own modules' interfaces so each offer is held to the refusal it fronts (R18).

   - `conclude-project-arm` (R14, R15, R23, R18): on a question concluded with no project, `conclude` is offered to an
     owner and to a joined non-owner of a project that live-cites it, and withheld from a member only invited there, from
     the owner of a project that severed or never cited it, from an administrator who joined nothing and from a machine;
     on an open question to every person. Over basis-versions' fixture (real record, membership, promotion, connections,
     basis-versions); the providers it does not build are stand-ins answering that nothing rests on the question and no
     case pins it.
   - `caseproduction` §3a (R8, R10, R14, R15, R18; DEC-69): `publish` is offered exactly where case-authoring's
     `publishCase` does not refuse the caller on position (NOT_THE_PROJECT_OWNER), a machine is withheld it by the machine
     rule, and a withheld caller's acts carry no narration of the position.
   - `publish` (R14, R8, R18): `case_member` measured after a real publication — `publish` withheld and refused
     ALREADY_A_CASE_MEMBER, `reopen` offered and accepted.
   The last two over case-authoring's fixture (real record, membership, promotion, connections, inquiry, basis-versions,
   publication, ratification, contradiction, case-authoring), with `case_member` asked of the case-tensions instance
   publication builds on the same host (N597). */
