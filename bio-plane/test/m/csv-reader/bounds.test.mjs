/* csv-reader R6 and R22 (fix round 9, G124 quotes; K4835 (1)): the ceilings this module keeps are runtime-limits' rows,
   taken through `boundOf`, with no numeric literal for a ceiling here. The behaviour at each limit is tested in text.test.mjs
   (R6, R22), standard-size.test.mjs and large-text.test.mjs; this file is the one quote check the plan's G124 asks for: the
   module's own declaration of each ceiling resolves to the table (K3268: no figure listed by hand in the test). */
