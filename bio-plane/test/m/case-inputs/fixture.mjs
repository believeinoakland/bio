/* case-inputs over the modules it uses, each the real one (record-core, membership, publication publish-schedule, case-account), on a real SQLite database (node:sqlite) standing in for a Durable Object's
   storage. It builds `case-inputs` alone: `case-authoring` is later in the order and is never built here (the split
   map's §3, §7 risk 1). So the case documents a test needs are written as `case-authoring`'s `op=publish` and
   ratification's commit would leave them: an unsigned one stored through `publication.storeCaseDocument` (its R21),
   with the acknowledgement list and the statement's writer this module answers, and a signed one by writing
   `case_documents`, `cases` and `published_cases` directly (publication R40's tables). What a later module fills is a
   stand-in the test controls: the review provider (publication R23, which `review` registers) over its `case_drafts`
   table (review R26's read contract). Every test drives `case-inputs` at its interface. */
