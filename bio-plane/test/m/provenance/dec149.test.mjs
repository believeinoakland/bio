/* provenance: DEC-149's sweep rows (T35-18; `build/plan/draft-T35-dec149-l1-l7.md`, plan rule 4). Member-facing text
   says "your group's Civicsmith" or names the thing; "the plane", "this plane" and "the instance" go. Each test names
   the row's string and reads it where a member reads it: the catalogue row, `captureGrade`'s `why`, and the files
   `testify` writes. Field and identifier names stay. */
