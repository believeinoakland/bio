/* G44 (fix round 6; K4662, K4665, K4655): a large workbook is refused, stated, before it can kill the object, and the
   largest one the add holds survives the workbook's whole lifecycle. Each case goes through `workbooksOps(...)` over the
   fixture's `world()`, the real modules on a real database, in a child process whose old space is capped as the plane's
   object leaves it (the sheet-worker-free stub engine answers every formula cell). Ids: R1 (amended: the order of its
   refusals, WORKBOOK_FILE_TOO_LARGE and WORKBOOK_TOO_LARGE), R2 (a read of a workbook stored over the bound) and R20 (a
   workbook is held whole up to the cells bound, and the largest one survives every act). The child's cap is runtime-
   limits' `capFor` (the one convention); the heavy cases here run alone (R-NOLOAD). */
