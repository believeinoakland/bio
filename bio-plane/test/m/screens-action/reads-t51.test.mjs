/* screens-action, fix round 4 (C14, this screens' part; K4429; P9, P10): the read set of each screen, asserted. A screen asks for what it
   draws once: no op twice in a load, none of the frame's `bootstrap` (control-plane R122: the page reads it once and hands it to the frame
   and the screen), no per-project repeat (`projectquestions`, `determinations` once on a plan), and the member's `queue` list only where
   the screen draws the member's own items (`dash-action`, R30; queue R93: the frame reads the count). The time of each read on the
   smoke copy is in the job record. */
