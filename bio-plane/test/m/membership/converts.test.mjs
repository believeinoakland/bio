/* The shares of eight old suites this module proves at its own interface (T19's convert entry; K619, their rows in
   `build/jobs/T17/legacy-tests.md`): `statusby`, `adminvote`, `founder-sight`, `members`, `project-authority`,
   `project-discoverable`, `ratify-authority` and `project-sight`. Each test names the requirements it proves and the
   suite it converts. What those suites assert of other modules (sign-in's sentence and the key cascade, which are
   `credentials`'; the control plane's tables; citation's, queue's, publication's acts) is not proved here. The ops are
   driven through `membershipOps`, whose stamps (`by`, `viewer`, `administer`) come from the query, as the control plane
   sends them, and never from the body. */
