/* T42 (T42-3; N833, D54, K2484; canon Membership §7.3): R60's hold acts. `actions` R52 `actionHold`, R56
   `actionHoldRelease` and R57 `holdReleasePreview` reach a hidden project at EXISTENCE for an administrator neither
   invited nor joined, naming its id and hold state only. This module's share is what those acts read of it (their
   Uses: `sight`, `visibilityOf`, `existenceAct`, `noSuchProject`; R44, R77, R78, R85): "may name" is FULL, or
   EXISTENCE of a HIDDEN project (actions R52), so this suite holds, at this module's interface, that the reads answer
   exactly that set, and that nothing else of the project's is opened by it. A test of this module imports no later
   module (P4), so `actions`' own suite (its t41) drives the acts themselves. Each id with a negative control (K874). */
