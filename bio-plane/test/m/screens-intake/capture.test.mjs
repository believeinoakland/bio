 * six acts as a member uses them, over the REAL store (fix round 10, K5054): the members are signed in by the real acts, an address is answered by the
 * world's network (an environment double, scripted: the bytes a site would serve), and `heldat`, `acquire`, `allocid`, `promote`, `captureupload`, `monitor`,
 * `monitorset`, `capturerequest`, `testify`, `opencaptures`, `heldcaptures`, `search` and `image` are the owners' own. What a test needs of a capture (its digest, the
 * document it was filed as, its title) it reads from what the page sent or from the owners' answers, never from a literal. A fault (an owner's refusal the real
 * acts cannot make, a silence, a held answer) is the only scripted answer, and each one says why. A sentence is asserted by its key through `setup-words` (R26),
