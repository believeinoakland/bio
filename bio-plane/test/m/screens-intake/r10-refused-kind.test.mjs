/* screens-intake fix round 10, cause R36 (G7; walk A7; R64): `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT {kind}` is drawn as the sentence reading-pipeline holds for that kind
 * (`reading-pipeline.index.unsupported_<kind>`), not as the stand-in "picture unread" with the raw kind beside it. The page is the served `capture` screen over the
 * REAL plane (`realplane.mjs`): a GIF is uploaded and what the plane stores for it is what `op=reading` answers. The local plane leaves a TIFF's reading unstored (the
 * live one stores it `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT`; why they differ is not established, K4428), so every kind is also tried at the part's interface over the word table. */
