/* screens-intake fix round 9 (SCREENS-INTAKE #23): R63 (G135c; SCAN E9: what became of an upload's reading, never "Text: None: no page has text" for a failed or owed
 * one), R64 (G135d; SHEET C05, X05: a refusal names its own cause and its figures) and R65 (G135f: the states of a read drawn from the job row, as `op=reading`
 * answers it). Every test enters by pressing the act over the real served page; a sentence is asserted by its key (R26) and a figure by the size word it is drawn in.
 *
 * The sentences these requirements add are the design's rows, owed to `later-ux.md` (K4269): until they reach the table the nearest held rows stand in, and a test
 * asserts the stand-in's key (`screen.document.text.unread.next`, `shell.unread`, `screen.document.reading.progress`, ...) and the figures, not a new English
 * sentence. R-SEAM: `op=reading`'s job-row answer (control-plane R135, job 38) and plane's `jobrow` (R107, job 37) are unmerged; the answer is the shape
 * R135 states (`state`, `written`, `skipped`, `owed`, `failed`, `rate_per_s`, `verdict`), made by the test. */
