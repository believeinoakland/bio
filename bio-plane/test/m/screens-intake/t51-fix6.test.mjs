 * Every test enters by pressing the act. A sentence is asserted by its key (R26). The words are the nearest held rows (K4269): `screen.capture.address.working.head`,

 * R-SEAM: acquisition's `fetch_pending` answer and capture's `opencaptures` listing are the providers' (G2), unmerged at this START: the screen is drawn against the shapes
