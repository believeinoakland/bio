/* screens-intake T51 fix round 4 (SCREENS-INTAKE #15; K4429): C9 R49 (the pre-flight's path), FC-23 (the login control's words), C14 (Held's read
 * set: the picker for the page, the full fields for the rows it draws; capture R102), C25 R54 (a PDF named by its title), and the rows
 * DEC-412 wrote (`filedhere`, `later.none`, `unread.next`). A sentence is asserted by its key (R26), never by its English. Every test
 * enters by pressing the act (or opening the page), never by calling a `done` function.
 *
 * Fix round 10 (K5054): over the REAL store. A document held is held by real acts (the page's own capture of an address, an upload and its promotion); a member
 * who may or may not see it is a participant of its project, or not (`projectinvite`, `projectjoin`); a site that changed is the world's network answering
 * another body (an environment double). Every value an assertion needs (a digest, a bundle id, the picker's order) is read from what those acts answered. A fault
 * is the only scripted answer. */
