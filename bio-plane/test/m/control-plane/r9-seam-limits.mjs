/* control-plane (fix round 9; K4837, K4842; R-SEAM, R-ONE, R-CLOCK, R-NOLOAD): SEAM SECTIONS 14 AND 15 of `t51-round9-seam.test.mjs`, THROUGH THE REAL PLANE (the Worker, object, alarm and R2 under
   Miniflare, a member's own acts; `makeKit` of `r8-kit.mjs`). The lead's one seam file calls `sections(kit, counting)`.

   14  a ceiling's sentence, the upload peak, the archive limits, and THE ALL-MODULES GREP (G124a, G124b, G124g, G124; R132, R125, R131, R130, R72)
         a  a PDF one byte over `boundOf("pdf","bytes")` uploaded is stated at once with its size, the limit and the key of the alpha sentence, owing nothing (no job row); one at
            the ceiling is not stated, its `reading` row is held and the alarm reads it (PDF A3 / A2);
         b  a 24 MiB text upload through the real door lands (the capture whole, a job row, no inline read) and, handed the door's own byte ledger, peaks at the file and at most two
            parts beyond it and is back to nothing held (the ledger's wiring is `owner-ops.mjs`, R72);
         g  the archive limits: a file declared one byte over the uploaded bound is refused by name with its size, the limit and the key, the bound itself accepted; an archive whose
            directory declares one byte over the unpacked bound is refused by name with its size and limit, the bound itself accepted (the lazy ZIP writer: nothing is materialised);
         G124 THE ALL-MODULES GREP (K3268: no hand-listing of another module's constants): every module's own source, from `build/modules.json`, is read for the ceiling constants it
            declares as numbers; each that does not resolve to `READ_BOUNDS` through `boundOf`/`statement` is reported with its module, file:line and name; the set outside ACCEPTED
            (constants that are no reading ceiling, each with its reason) must be empty.
   15  the press, transcribe and the no-cursor door (G126e, G126h; R131, R125, R130, R123)
         the OCR press `pdfstructure&ocr=1` and `pagetranscribe` on a PDF over 2 MiB and on a scan: the object is not loaded in the request (the counting door's count of R2 gets of
            the whole object: 0) and no OCR call is made inside it; `owedwork` lists what is left;
         the no-cursor door read of a 2 MB sheet/CSV: no inline read, the row exists, the last row is found by `op=search` after the ticks.
   Counts, values and fields at the door; never a wall time, never a sentence a member reads (R-CLOCK, R-WORDS). Where a provider has not merged, the test keeps its real assertion and its
   title says "(red until <module> <job> merges)". */
