/* control-plane R72 (fix round 9; capture R111, R113; B82 (3)): THE DOOR'S WORD ALONE. `declared`, the length an upload says it has, is deleted from the address for every op, and for
   `captureupload` and `captureuploadpart` it is set to the request's own Content-Length when that is a whole number. Driven through the door over the recording store: the store's route
   sees the door's figure, never the caller's; a request with no Content-Length carries none; any other op's address carries none whatever the caller sent. */
