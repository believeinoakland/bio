/* control-plane R133, R134 (fix round 9, G128f, G129e; X15, X20; K4831 (4); amends R123, R58; `acquisition` unpack, `plane` R97): EVERY DOCUMENT A PROMOTION STORES IS FOLLOWED, AND A TRANSIENT STORE
   ERROR NEVER FILES AN ARCHIVE'S MEMBER AWAY FOR GOOD.
   R133: the 17th and the 30th member of an archive promoted together are each followed: their job row is registered (R130) BEFORE any inline read, and only the first
   `READING_FOLLOWED_MAX` (16) are read inline in the request; the rest are owed as rows, none dropped, the answer says `reading_pending`. A promotion of 3 documents follows 3.
   R134: `promoteArchive` (and the door's `op=unpack` over it) names a member whose put or promotion did not answer or threw as `not_promoted` with `transient: true` (it stays owed: the archive's
   `unpack` job is registered and the answer says `unpack_pending`), a member the store answered `ok: false` for without `transient` (it is its own file's refusal and is not retried), and the
   members of a nested archive or a continuation are promoted into the archive's project as the first are.
   Driven through `makeFetch(hooks)` over the harness's recording store (the pattern of `r123-reading.test.mjs` and `archive.test.mjs`); the whole path with the real plane is the seam's §6.

   Red against the tree before round 9's change: R133's rows (the old door registered only the documents it did not read, and read at most 16 and registered none of the 17th on: `pendingadd` was
   called 0 times for a read-inline document and the 17th was only written down when its inline read failed), R134's `transient` flag and `unpack_pending` (the old `not_promoted` carried a
   code alone and a transient failure was `not_filed` for good). The controls (3 documents, a refusal of the file's own bytes) are green before and after. */
