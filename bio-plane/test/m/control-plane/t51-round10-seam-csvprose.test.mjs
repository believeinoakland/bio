/* control-plane R100 (csv-reader R26, fix round 10; K5138, K5148; WALK-FINAL-06 cause 1): the walker's case through the real door. A member uploads `comma-minutes.txt`, four lines of
   prose with a comma on three of them, declared plain text: the file is read as prose (the reading carries no `cells` and no `dialect`), not as a table whose columns are the clauses.
   Controls: a real three-column CSV named `.txt` is still read as a table (`dialect`, `cells`); the same prose declared `text/csv` keeps csv-reader R7's presence rule and is a table. Run
   against the Miniflare plane (the seam kit), the bytes the member's own upload sent. */
