/* control-plane (fix round 8, G120, G121; K4817; R-SEAM, R-ONE): ONE `caseratify`, COUNTED. The G59 case of `t51-round7-seam.test.mjs` (a case citing one sentence of a vouched upload, signed in one sitting) is
   signed through the counting door (`wrap-entry.mjs`) with the request's calls listed in the order they began and ended (`x-wrap-events`): the Worker's calls to the object and to R2. A
   count of calls and of how many were in flight together is the test, never a time (R-CLOCK: Miniflare answers each in a millisecond, so a chain of 59 costs 80 ms and looks fine; live it is 13 s).
   The figures are the plan's (G120 (3), review2 N7): the object calls that read independent facts before the signature check are issued together (or folded into one); the case file's
   `head` and `put` of its files are issued concurrently, peak in flight at least 6; the longest chain awaited one after another is at most 25 (it was 59), the figure derived from the chain:
   the object chain of 21 less the 2 calls saved by issuing the three independent reads together = 19, plus the case file's R2 depth with 12 files in groups of 8 = 2 groups x (head, put) = 4,
   plus the 2 `PUBLISHED.get` calls = 6, so 25. The answer's fields are today's (a golden list of its keys). Red by name until `ratification` (G120) and `public-read` (G121) have merged. */
