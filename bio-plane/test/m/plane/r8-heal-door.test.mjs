/* plane R102 G93 (fix round 9; plan section 3, job 20; K4565, K4807 (2); diagnosis-R8-watchdog.md Finding 2 (a)): ANY REQUEST RE-ARMS. `heal` has no caller today, so a lost alarm waits for the next cron slot (up to five
   minutes; three slots were delivered hours late). On workerd under Miniflare, the plane's own Worker and `Store` with the REAL alarm (`r8-headofline-entry.mjs`, `Headline`: the plane's `Store` plus debug routes
   that read and delete the alarm and count the object's calls on the platform's alarm), through `plane.fetch` (the real door): a row is owed (a 4 MB text uploaded by a member; its reading is the ledger's), the alarm
   is DELETED by the test, then ONE ordinary read is made, and `getAlarm()` is set afterwards. Storage reads are counted, never timed inside the object (R-CLOCK); the 5 s of "once in five seconds" is the test's own
   clock outside the object, as the requirement states it.
   RED BY NAME until plane-2 (job 37) merges `Store.fetch`'s call of the scheduler's `heal(now)` (R102): today nothing calls it.
   - the founder's read (`op=owedwork`) re-arms; a member's read (`op=whoami`) re-arms as well;
   - a second read within 5 s makes no second look (the alarm calls counted do not move), a read after the 5 s does;
   - control: a request during a firing in progress changes nothing (no arm, no look beyond the firing's own). */
