/* The decisions the record routes to a member (R75; C62, DEC-378, K4169) on Home and the queue, on the real served page over the REAL store
   (store-request's `storeWorld()`, op-tables §5.3): the document whose issuer is not known, the proposed administrator, the declared expertise and
   the owner votes are made by the real acts, so the queue the page reads and every act it sends are the real store's. The owners' declared ops
   are registered first (`taskdecide` is `tasks`' alone), so the authority form is drawn; every request is checked by the harness against the
   owners' declarations. Every sentence is asserted as `word(key, vars)` (R34), so no test holds a sentence's English.
   The world is imported before the page: it registers every owner's declared ops (op-declarations R81), so `OPS` holds `taskdecide` when the page reads it. */
