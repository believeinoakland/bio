/* screens-daily against interface-shell R21's screen contract and R7's common rules, at the module's interface
   (`SCREENS`) and on the real served page (interface-shell's harness). It holds no sentence's English (R34): its words are keys. The registry is read from git at
   6f0d88d8d5, PR #33's head as merged into `tranche/T47` at L11's START (wizard-scripts R35, K3127), so a later edit of the
   working copy does not move it. Since T48 (wizard-scripts R38) it is read at PR #34's merge, 4664e8efd4: `elsewhere` (no acts),
   the queue's `owed:updatelater`, Home's item acts. */
