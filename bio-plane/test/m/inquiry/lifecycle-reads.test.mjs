/* Inquiry's shares of four retired suites, converted to module tests (T18; build/jobs/T17/legacy-tests.md's rows):
   - `test/inquiry.test.mjs`: the entry requirements over inquiry@1 and over legacy PROB/focus documents, each judged by
     the vocabulary it was written under (R2, Terms); a legacy `surfaced` problem treated as an inquiry by this module's
     acts and projection (R1, R20, R21, R12); the title rule over the question (R10). The catalogue's `checkBundle`
     rows, promotion's `bundles.title`, retrieval's type filter and facet, instance-setup's page and legacy-store's boot
     normaliser are not inquiry's and are not here.
   - `test/rec173-migration-replay.test.mjs`: the migration-replay row a creation admitted as a replay records, and none
     for a surfacing or a revision (R12), read back as the migrated arm of `surfaced_in` (R49). The replay verification
     is control-plane's; the surfacing row is ai-runs'.
   - `test/meaningquery.test.mjs`: legs written by a real promotion are what `leg:` finds (R12's projection, R40's
     read contract), and a revision re-derives them. The compiler, its vocabulary and its gate are query-language's and
     retrieval's.
   - `test/reevaluation.test.mjs`: what this module's acts answer about the re-evaluation obligation through `onRaised`
     (a deferral, a division; R21, R25, R42) and the CITED refusals that stand where the obligation cannot be raised
     (R20, R23), over `restingOn` and `restsOnLive` (R16, R17). The obligation read (`op=reevaluations`), a reopening
     and a new edition are reevaluation's, promotion's and publication's.
   Driven through the real promotion, record-core, connections and (for `leg:`) retrieval, as the fixture builds them. */
