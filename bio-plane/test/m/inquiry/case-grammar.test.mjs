/* inquiry's grammar where it meets the case (LEGACY-TESTS, T18): the inquiry shares of four old suites, converted.
   - publish.test.mjs block 7 (old 1144-1204): C-21.2 per axis, the four probes and the edge cases (no edition, an
     edition never published, a leg authoring its own grade on a published case, the inert ungraded leg, an unrated
     axis) — inquiry R7.
   - multifinding.test.mjs block 4 (old 1050-1089): C-21.2 per FINDING and per axis, two findings frozen differently
     — inquiry R7; and blocks 2b/3 (old 814-833, 1015-1033): a finding's bytes naming case keys, C-2.8 per key — inquiry
     R2 (and R38, C-2.8 as the grammar uses it).
   - caseproduction.test.mjs block 8 (old 1021-1076): the case_project, case_roles and all-eight-keys adversaries —
     inquiry R2's C-2.8 arm, each key named.
   - grounds.test.mjs blocks 3(a) and 4 (old 420-453, 488-559): the grounds gate — inquiry R8: the agent,
     token:member, class:member and TOKEN:member spellings, an undated, doubled, empty or ill-labelled ground, a
     grounds block over no basis, the half-labelled basis and the label with no grounds[] block.
   The old suites drove these through op=promote/op=ratify on the whole plane; here they are driven at inquiry's
   interface: the pure `checkInquiryEntry` / `checkInquiryBasis`, the instance's `checkEntry` and `ground`, and the
   write through `promotion.promote` (the fixture's `w.promote`), where inquiry's check (R11) judges the basis with
   the published registry the test controls (`world({ published })`). What the case gate does with these bytes at
   op=ratify is ratification's and is not asserted here. */
