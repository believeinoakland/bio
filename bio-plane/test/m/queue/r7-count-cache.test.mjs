/* G80 (T51 fix round 7; B.md:37, A.md:41; diagnosis-R7-screens.md S4): the Queue count is recomputed from scratch by every call
   (12 concurrent `queue?count=true` took 5.6 s). `op=queue` with `count: true` (R93) is now one count per viewer, record-core's
   write counter (R89, R90) and a bucket of the clock: reused while none of the three moves, recomputed for any write.
   The recompute is COUNTED (the producers' one read and `tasks`' read asked), never timed (R-CLOCK: workerd freezes the clock
   during synchronous work). The key is not a version of the reading ledger: a task, a question, a deadline, a notice or a mute
   changing must move the next count. Driven at the module's interface (`queueFeed`, the ops map as the plane calls it). */
