/* reading-pipeline R29 (T41-9; N820, D21; text-chain R104): the AI's reading of the pages Civicsmith's own text
 * recognition could not read, a transcription tier above tier 3, at a member's act on the account that pays for it,
 * within its limits (`use: "transcribe"`), never under a "no AI" material limit. Tested at the module's interface:
 * `read` with the `transcription` its caller hands in, and the pieces `tier4Pages` and `tier4Extend` (R23); and R30, the
 * re-read's seed (`tier3SeedFrom`, `tier3Extend`) keeping the pages the AI read.
 *
 * THE ACCOUNT IS REAL (K874's negative controls): record-core, membership and credentials over one SQLite database
 * (node:sqlite, the engine a Durable Object runs), and the account is asked of `credentials.accountFor` (its R56) as
 * the caller hands it in. The limits (`ai-use.useCheck`) and the AI itself are the caller's and are scripted here. */
