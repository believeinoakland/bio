/* instance-setup R101 (T51 fix round; K4168, K4202): each op this module serves that the screens send is declared in
   DECLARED_OPS beside the ops map, and the declaration is held true against the op as the door runs it (test-support R15):
   only its requires raise no refusal naming a declared field, a call without each required one is refused naming it, and a
   field outside accepts is dropped or refused naming it. The ops map is called as the door calls it, the stamps in the
