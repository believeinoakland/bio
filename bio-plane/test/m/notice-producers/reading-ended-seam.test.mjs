/* R29 (fix round 10; the marked clause, the seam over the real job table: control-plane seam section 11, job 43): the `reading-ended` producer
   built from `readingsEnded` over the rows the REAL job table answers. The job table is plane's (`plane/pending.mjs`, `readingsEnded`, plane R98), later in the
   order than this module, so its answer is not built here: `READING_ROWS` below is the contract, stated as data exactly as plane's own `Store` answers it (member as
   `member:<id>`, `ended_at` in epoch milliseconds, `why` the refusal's bound key or the reader's final reason, the cursor `<ended_at>\u0001<sha>\u0001<kind>`), and the
   plane's test runs it against its real table (the `fixtures-run` line it carries). This test drives `noticeItems` at its interface over those rows. */
