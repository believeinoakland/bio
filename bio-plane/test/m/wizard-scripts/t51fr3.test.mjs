/* wizard-scripts R49 (T51 fix round 3; C64; DEC-401, DEC-402; K4356; amends R47, R48): the registry re-taken at `43379a1a44`, where
   `request` gains the act `entitycreate` ("Use this office"), so a member can name a federal office from the records request.
   Every test drives the module at its interface, over the carried data and the vendored design file it is held equal to; the
   generator is run as a command, as R44 to R48's tests do. */
