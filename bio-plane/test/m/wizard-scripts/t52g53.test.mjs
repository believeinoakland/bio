/* wizard-scripts R50 (T51 fix round 6; G53; DEC-419; K4393, K4691; amends R49): the registry re-taken at `f72b2f8a4c`, where the
   design adds `projectjoin` to `start-send`, `request` and `action`. The shell's `checkScreens` admits a page's act only when
   the generated registry holds it, so the vendored file must stay the design's own file on the tranche. Every test drives the
   module at its interface, over the carried data and the vendored design file it is held equal to; the generator is run as a
   command, as R44 to R49's tests do. */
