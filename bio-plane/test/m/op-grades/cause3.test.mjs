/* op-grades, fix round 3 (T51; cause-shell-3, C64): the grades of the acts the `request` screen and the settings screen send.

   (`entities` R64) are administrators' acts, graded from their owners' declarations (R49, R50) as BOB's reading states: `scanmirror`
   under the ground `substrate`, `officeconfirm` Reasoned. Until the owners merge, a scripted double of their declared rows stands
   in; once they have, the owners' own rows are read and must agree. */
