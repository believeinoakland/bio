/* op-grades R54 (T51 fix round 10; PUBLISH-SCHEDULE #6 J8; amends R49, R50): an owner's `irreversible` row is accepted only in
   agreement with its hand row. The module is exercised through its exports over fixture owner rows, no real module: the owner
   rows are built here from this module's own hand rows (their words are read from `NON_ACTS`, never typed), so each test
   checks the agreement the registration makes, not a copy of another module's answer. Each test loads fresh instances, so a
   registration in one never reaches the next, and `ref`, an untouched twin, is what the original tables are read from. */
