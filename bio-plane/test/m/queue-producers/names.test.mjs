/* C94 (fix round 2), queue-producers' part: a member is named by handle, the founder included, and the founder never by her id.
   `#memberName` serves R14's key, R33's author and R46-R48's `who`; R44's inviter reads through it. The founder's id is `admin`; her
   handle is the one she holds (member-roster R144); a founder with none is `member.founder.unnamed`'s word, never `admin`. Any other
   member with no handle is named by her id as R46 states (the word list holds no key for her: the job's QUESTION). Every sentence is
   checked against `word`'s key (K3810). */
