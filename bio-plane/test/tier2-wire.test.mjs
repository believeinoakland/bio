/* REC-98 / D-283 — THE TIER-2 PER-PAGE RULE, REACHED THROUGH THE OPS.
 *
 * CPDF-20 landed `perPageTierWinner` / `mergeTier2Text` / `tier2Note` in
 * `src/textchain.mjs`, drove them over four real Oakland council PDFs, and then
 * PROVED THEM UNREACHED rather than implying it: `npm run build` produced a
 * byte-identical `bio-plane.bundled.mjs`, because nothing imported the new
 * exports and esbuild shook them out. Only the bundle MANIFEST changed.
 *
 * THIS SUITE IS THE OTHER HALF. `tier-pagewise.test.mjs` drives the RULE; this
 * one drives the WIRE — the two call sites in `index.mjs` CPDF-20's DELEGATION
 * names, through `op=pdfstructure` and `op=acquire`, with the REAL pdf-worker
 * running from its committed bundle under the same miniflare. A store-level
 * test and a passing battery are not evidence a caller can reach a feature
 * (`op=invitelook` shipped a ReferenceError while 1,276 assertions passed), and
 * a rule nothing imports is the strongest possible form of that.
 *
 * WHAT THE WIRE MAKES TRUE THAT THE RULE ALONE CANNOT:
 *   1. one document, TWO TIERS — `text.pages[n].tier` differs within one answer;
 *   2. the ACQUIRE chain records the winner PER PAGE (`extent: {kind:"pages"}`),
 *      which is §5.2's second half and is not a merge at all;
 *   3. a page tier 1 read BETTER is kept, through the op, on real bytes.
 *
 * THE ROUTING HALF IS NOT TOUCHED AND THIS SUITE PINS THAT. `needsTier2` is
 * unchanged on purpose (D-283 is the ASSIGNMENT half), and one consequence is
 * MEASURED here rather than argued: `legistar-73618`, the committed fixture
 * whose page 1 is the very page that falsified §5.2 as written, DOES NOT
 * ESCALATE — tier 1 read it at 1,815 characters with a single unmapped code, so
 * the document-level predicate declines and the merge is never consulted. That
 * is asserted below, so the limit is in the suite rather than only in a report.
 * [The figure read 1,925 until D-517, 2026-09-24, and had been stale since
 * D-481 changed the line-break policy — it matched no reading this suite could
 * produce. It is corrected to the measured one rather than deleted, because
 * what it records — a margin far short of the predicate — is still the point,
 * and the margin is now 1,815 against 1 marker. `needsTier2` compares RAW
 * `counts.chars`, so this margin is the only thing standing between a
 * whitespace change and an escalation verdict; D-517 measured all nine of
 * M-141's documents both ways and NO verdict moves, the closest non-escalating
 * margin being this one at 1,814 against a 24-character move (M-145).]
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL: `node bio-plane/test/nc-rec98.mjs` — COMMITTED, so it re-runs
 * in one step. NINE rows, each armed ALONE with every other defence held open,
 * each restored from a uniquely named per-arm pristine copy verified by sha256
 * AND by `cmp` with the byte count printed and floored, and each DECLARING
 * before it ran what must fail and what must not:
 *   (0) BASELINE, nothing armed -> exit 0 with a real assertion tally, never a bare 0.
 *   (1) A1 CALL SITE 1 REMOVED, `op=pdfstructure` returning the member's answer
 *       whole -> exit 1, and it must fail on "one document, TWO tiers".
 *   (2) A2 CALL SITE 2 REMOVED, the acquire assembly assigning wholesale -> exit 1,
 *       and it must fail on the SCOPED mixed chain, NOT on the structure arms.
 *   (3) A3 §5.2 SHIPPED AS WRITTEN, the second condition dropped from the rule
 *       itself -> exit 1 on the degradation page, through the op.
 *   (4) A4 THE TIER NOT STAMPED on the answer -> exit 1: a merge that is right
 *       and silent about it.
 *   (5) A5 THE MEMBER'S OWN NOTES DROPPED -> exit 1 on the over-envelope decline.
 *   (6) A6 D-251's PRODUCER CARRY-FORWARD DROPPED -> exit 1 on the encrypted
 *       document, the only shape that reaches the merge's wholesale branch.
 *   (7) A7 THE FIXTURE TRUNCATED, two of four PDFs hidden -> exit 1 at the
 *       manifest, naming the missing file rather than thinning silently.
 *   (8) A8 OVER-STRICTNESS, the wire spelled differently at all three sites ->
 *       exit 0. Correct work in a spelling nobody anticipated must PASS.

   tier 1 still wins every page it won before, no page's tier flipped, and the
   degradation guard still refuses every award it refused. What moved is tier 1's
   CHARACTER COUNT, and it fell for a reason that is not slack: D-481 stopped
   emitting a newline per positioning operator, so the counts below lost the
   INJECTED NEWLINES and not one decoded glyph. Tier 2's figures (580, 3,416, 100)
   are the member's decode and are untouched, which is what makes the fall
   readable. Taken from what the suite PRINTED, never by subtraction.
   A FINDING THIS EXPOSED, reported rather than fixed here: the per-page award
   compares raw `text.length`, so it counts whatever line-break policy tier 1
   happens to run. The measured page's margin over tier 2 narrowed 129 -> 77
   characters without one glyph changing hands. A page's TIER should not be able
   to turn on a newline; the comparison wants non-whitespace characters.
   [THAT FINDING IS CLOSED, and it is corrected here rather than deleted because
   its closing is the news: `perPageTierWinner` reads `decodedChars`, which
   counts NON-WHITESPACE code points, since D-501 ruled glyphs and D-514 moved
   the sites. The award no longer turns on a line-break policy.]

   FIGURES MOVED AGAIN 2026-09-24 by D-517, and the CLAIM at every site below is
   STILL unchanged — no page's tier flipped, the merge keeps and replaces exactly
   what it did, and the degradation guard refuses exactly what it refused. What
   moved is tier 1's CHARACTER COUNT a second time, and again for a reason that
   is not slack: D-517 stopped emitting a separator where the document had
   already written one, so the counts below lost 24 REDUNDANT SPACES on
   `legistar-73618` and one on `legistar-73545` page 6, and not one decoded
   glyph. THE NON-WHITESPACE COUNTS DID NOT MOVE AT ALL, and THAT is why this
   landing is an independent confirmation of D-501/D-514's counter rather than a
   second instance of the finding above: the descriptive raw counts in this file
   moved while the award, which now reads glyphs, could not see the change.
   Tier 2's figures (580, 3,416, 100) are the member's decode and are untouched
