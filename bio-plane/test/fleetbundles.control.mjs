/* FL-9's, FL-10's, FLEET #4's, M0-188's AND M0-152's NEGATIVE CONTROL DRIVER — eighteen arms
 * plus a baseline, re-runnable in one step:
 *
 * TALLY MOVED 2026-09-25 at c22-batch29's union of M0-188 (on main) and M0-152, COUNTED off the table
 * rather than added up: `1 1b 2 2-noinstall 2b 3 4 5 5b-comment 5b-code 6 6b 7 8 9 10 10b 10c` is EIGHTEEN.
 * M0-188's *"fifteen"* was itself one short — it named arm 9's missed append and then added its three to
 * twelve rather than thirteen, so main's table held SIXTEEN — and M0-152 appended `5b-comment` and
 * `5b-code` without moving the head (its side still read *"twelve"*). The third decay by APPEND.
 *
 * TALLY MOVED 2026-09-24 (M0-188) from *"twelve arms plus a baseline"*, which was
 * already stale by one when it was corrected: FLEET #4 appended arm 9 on 2026-09-23
 * without moving the head. M0-188 appends 10, 10b and 10c, so twelve -> fifteen, and
 * the drift is named rather than quietly absorbed — the same treatment M0-29 gave it
 * below, and the second time this number has decayed by APPEND.
 *
 * TALLY CORRECTED 2026-09-14 (M0-29, D-343). This line read *"six arms plus a
 * baseline"* and the driver announces THIRTEEN. THIS ONE DECAYED IN TWO STEPS
 * AND ONLY THE SECOND IS THE ONE THE RECORD ALREADY KNEW ABOUT:
 *
 *   - It was ALREADY FALSE IN ITS OWN LANDING COMMIT `d83695b` (FL-9), where the
 *     table held EIGHT arms plus a baseline — the variants `1b`, `2-noinstall`
 *     and `2b` were written during the item, after the head sentence, and the
 *     six the sentence names are the six the item set out with.
 *   - `3607b3b` (FL-10) then APPENDED `6`, `6b`, `7` and `8` — its own claim says
 *     so in those words — taking the table to twelve arms plus a baseline.
 *
 * The count now names BOTH items, because a driver whose head names one item and
 * whose arms serve two is the state that let the number drift unread. THE ARMS
 * ARE REAL: every one has its own anchor, subject and declared must-fail /
 * must-not pair, so the DECLARATION is corrected and no arm is restored or
 * removed (`casepin.control.mjs` is D-333's worked precedent).
 *
 *     node test/fleetbundles.control.mjs          # every arm, in order
 *     node test/fleetbundles.control.mjs 2b       # one arm
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT A `.test.mjs`: it EDITS REAL SOURCES and RENAMES a real
 * `node_modules`, and a file a `node --test` run discovers must never be one that
 * rewrites the tree underneath the suites running beside it (PL-3/PL-4/PL-11).
 * Named to `node --test` explicitly, it refuses and touches nothing (T23, K1120).
 *
 * THE THREE RULES THIS PROJECT PAID FOR, obeyed here:
 *
 *   1. PRISTINE COPIES LIVE INSIDE THIS WORKTREE, never in a shared scratchpad.
 *      PL-10's harness was overwritten mid-turn by a concurrent worker writing
 *      the same path. Each snapshot is held in memory for the arm and written
 *      back in a `finally`, so an arm that throws still restores.
 *   2. EVERY RESTORE IS VERIFIED BY CONTENT **AND** BY sha256, with a byte floor.
 *      UI-38 met a harness that reported a byte-identical restore over a file it
 *      had not restored.
 *   3. THE SUITE'S OUTPUT IS CAPTURED TO A FILE, NEVER TO A PIPE. D-282: a suite
 *      calling `process.exit()` discards unflushed PIPE writes, and a tally read
 *      `-1` for exactly that reason on a control that looked fine. The suite's
 *      EXIT STATUS is read from `spawnSync().status`, which is the process's own
 *      and never a pipeline's.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE WRITES A COMMITTED ARTIFACT (T23, K1118): arms 5 and 8 rebuild in memory; every other arm edits a
 * source and restores it by content and sha256.
 *
 * EACH ARM IS ARMED ALONE, with every other defence held open, and each names
 * what MUST fail AND what MUST NOT.
 *
 * RE-POINTED 2026-10-01 (LEGACY-TESTS #18, T20; N442, N31, N438): `tools/` and `scripts/coverage.mjs` are deleted, so
 * arm 5's (b) and (c) and M0-152's two arms beside it (`5b-comment`, `5b-code`), whose whole subject was the gate's
 * doc-facing derivation and coverage's floor, are retired with them; arm 6b arms the plane's entry where it now is,
 * `src/plane/index.mjs`; arms 10, 10b and 10c arm the ONE remedy constant (`REBUILD`) in `fleet-bundle.mjs`, which the
 * suite's arm (j) now reads through `verifyStatic`'s findings, never through the guard's source. The tally, counted off
 * the table below: `1 1b 2 2-noinstall 2b 3 4 5 6 6b 7 8 9 10 10b 10c` is SIXTEEN arms plus a baseline.
