/* row-census — promotion R50's census suite (N319, K382, K408, K431; LEGACY-TESTS #11, T13), promotion's own since T22's
   opening (K1006: legacy-tests retired, its files re-owned; PROMOTION #23 is the first promotion job to hold it).

   Promotion pins `ROW_CENSUS` = {version, rows, digest} beside `CATALOG_VERSION`: the census of every refusal row, in
   any module's table, as its last stamp read them (R34, R50). Promotion cannot read a later module's table (P4), so
   this suite holds the pin against the tree, computing the census EXACTLY as R50 words it (`row-census.mjs`, whose
   header states the reading; this suite reproduced promotion's own figure on its stamp commit 54abd9a659: 820 rows,
   f01ed42a…).

   WHAT PASSES. The census of the tree IS the pin; or it is the pin once the rows the open tranche's job records name
   `awaiting stamp` are taken back out (R50, K408: a row changed after the stamp by a job in a later layer, which the
   next tranche's layer-2 promotion job stamps). Each such row is declared below with the record that names it, the
   declaration is VERIFIED against that record (a line naming the check and `awaiting stamp`), and the row is LISTED.
   WHAT FAILS, naming the row: any other difference (a row that arrived, departed, or changed its check, code, `where`
   or translation with no record, or a stamp that missed one), found by diffing against the stamp's own lines
   (`fixtures/row-census-<version>.jsonl`, itself held to the pin's digest).
   NEGATIVE CONTROL: (run 2026-09-29, LEGACY-TESTS #11; the first three arms are in the suite and run with it, the
   fourth on a scratch worktree, restored by `git checkout`) (1) a row added to the census without a re-pin -> the
   comparison fails naming `arrived with no record: C-999.1 CONTROL_ARRIVAL`; (2) a stamped row taken out -> it fails
   naming `departed with no record: C-59.6 MINT_EXHAUSTED`; (3) that row's translation changed -> it fails naming
   `changed with no record: C-59.6 MINT_EXHAUSTED`, and a declared `awaiting stamp` row the tree does not bear out is a
   failure, not an exemption; (4) a row `C-59.99 CONTROL_ROW` added to record-core's own `RECORD_CORE_CHECKS` on the real
   tree -> 7 pass 1 fail, `CENSUS MOVED: arrived with no record: C-59.99 CONTROL_ROW`.
   RE-PINNED 2026-09-30 (LEGACY-TESTS #12, T14; PROMOTION #15, N318, N350): over 1.44.0, the stamp's own lines
   (`fixtures/row-census-1.44.0.jsonl`, 827 lines) reproduced by this reader on the stamp commit 872f6d4bd8 (827 rows,
   5eae043f…); the sort's tie broken by the line (N350); C-96.1's held-twice and open-tie assertions and 1.43.0's
   declarations retired.
   RE-PINNED 2026-09-30 (LEGACY-TESTS #14, T16; PROMOTION #17): over 1.46.0, the stamp's own lines
   (`fixtures/row-census-1.46.0.jsonl`, 877 lines) reproduced by this reader on the stamp commit 1dcde36e8b (877 rows,
   1002f871…); 1.45.0's declarations retired, T16's layers 3+ declared (see AWAITING_STAMP). Negative control re-run
   (private worktree): arms (1)-(3) in the suite pass; (4) C-59.99 CONTROL_ROW added to `RECORD_CORE_CHECKS` -> 7 pass
   1 fail, `CENSUS MOVED: arrived with no record: C-59.99 CONTROL_ROW`.
   RE-PINNED 2026-09-30 (LEGACY-TESTS #15, T17; PROMOTION #18, K577, K579): over 1.47.0, the stamp's own lines
   (`fixtures/row-census-1.47.0.jsonl`, 879 lines) reproduced by this reader on the stamp commit 6645daa0e0 (879 rows,

   retired; T17's layers 3+ declared (see AWAITING_STAMP).
   RE-PINNED 2026-10-01 (LEGACY-TESTS #18, T20; PROMOTION #21, K884): over 1.50.0, the stamp's own lines
   (`fixtures/row-census-1.50.0.jsonl`, 986 lines) reproduced by this reader on the stamp commit 49c6e2762a (986 rows,

   declared (see AWAITING_STAMP). The negative control no longer needs a snapshot: it drives `compare` against a stamp
   it makes from the tree's own lines, so it holds at every stamp (K884).

   (see AWAITING_STAMP), intent's registration among the compositions. A record may name its rows as a list under one
   line naming them `awaiting stamp` (FILINGS #9's record): the verification reads the line's paragraph.
