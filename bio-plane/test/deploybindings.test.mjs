/* D-202's closing half — the plane's deployed bindings derive from
 * wrangler.jsonc with the slug substituted, and this suite is why that logic
 * lives in `scripts/derive-bindings.mjs` instead of inside deploy.mjs: a
 * script that acts on import cannot be driven without deploying.
 *
 * Arms run against SYNTHETIC configs built to disagree in one specific way
 * each (the resolveversion.test.mjs lesson: a suite that only asserts "the
 * real tree agrees" proves nothing about the predicate), plus one live arm
 * against the real wrangler.jsonc, which is the ratchet.
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL: RUN 2026-09-14, two hand arms against the module itself,
 * pristine copy taken first, restore verified by sha256 both times —
 * (a) remove the bio-plane→slug substitution -> 16 of 20 FAIL, every one
 * NAMED and none a crash: the module's own PHANTOM_TARGET guard turns every
 * derivation into a refusal, so the module fails CLOSED (a deploy under this
 * arm would refuse, not ship the phantom) and the suite reports it. The
 * arm's FIRST firing crashed the suite instead — bare deriveBindings calls
 * let the guard's throw eat the tally (D-93 inside a control, the third
 * sighting in this session's own instruments in one day) — which is why every
 * should-succeed call now goes through derive()/named() and a refusal shows
 * as a failing value. (b) make the unknown-binding-class refusal a silent
 * drop -> 1 of 20 FAIL, the refusal arm alone — honest and sufficient: the
 * drop only manifests when an unknown class is PRESENT, and that arm is the
 * one that presents one. The header's first draft predicted 4/20 and 2/20
 * before the arms ran; these are the measured figures.
 * Restored byte-identically after each, 20/20 green.
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL (DIST-9): RUN 2026-09-24, one arm, declared before arming: delete the INSTANCE_AI_TOKEN push from
 * `deriveBindings` -> 37 passed, 1 failed, exactly "DIST-9: INSTANCE_AI_TOKEN is SENT…". Restored by cp, verified by
 * sha256 (2981bdfb…) and byte compare; 38/38 after. The NO-INVENTION arm cannot fail by that arm; it is armed by
 * the wizard suite's N1, where invention has a place to happen.
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL (D-54): RUN 2026-09-23, three arms, each ALONE, pristine copy
 * per arm, restore verified by sha256 and cmp; baseline 36/36 —
 * (A) replace wrangler.jsonc's `"limits": { "subrequests": 10000 }` -> 34/36,
 * FAIL "the real config states an explicit subrequest ceiling the release path
 * derives" (NO_SUBREQUEST_LIMIT) and "the ceiling's site carries its reason" (the
 * reason arm anchors on the `"limits"` key, so it goes with it — declared the
 * first, observed both). (B) drop `limits: deriveLimits(wranglerCfg),` from
 * deploy.mjs's metadata -> 35/36, FAIL "deploy.mjs's upload metadata carries the
 * derived limits". (C) make limitsReadBack read ABSENT limits as MATCH -> 35/36,
 * FAIL "read-back: settings stating no limits (biosmoke7's measured shape) are
 * UNDETERMINED, never a match". Restored, 36/36 green. Over-strictness arm:
 * cpu_ms beside subrequests is carried, not refused.
