/* CPDF-13 — THE CALIBRATION CONSTRUCT (D-183, D-253).
 *
 * A CALIBRATION IS A DATED, IDENTIFIED FIDELITY MEASUREMENT OF A NAMED
 * DERIVATION ENGINE AND VERSION, STORED WITH THE PROBE INPUTS AND THE SCORES
 * THAT PRODUCED IT.
 *
 * This module is that construct and — exactly as `textchain.mjs` holds no
 * engine — it holds NO ENGINE, NO PROBE CORPUS AND NO MEASURED NUMBER. It knows
 * what a measurement must carry to be one, how two measurements of the same
 * engine COMPARE, and what each direction of that comparison is allowed to
 * cause. The day an engine is calibratable in this instance, the honesty rules
 * are already built, already driven, and already refusing.
 *
 * ===================================================================== *
 * WHY THE CONSTRUCT IS ENGINE-GENERIC, WHICH IS THE ITEM'S FIRST WORD
 * ===================================================================== *
 *
 * D-183 was raised about Moondream. CPDF-11 then returned NO-GO on Moondream
 * (DEC-42: it could not answer coordinates), so the engine that provoked this
 * is not the engine that will first use it — and that is the argument, not an
 * inconvenience. THREE engines have one problem and D-164's lesson is to solve
 * it once rather than three times after the fact:
 *
 *   - TIER-2 pdf.js has a PINNED VERSION THAT WILL MOVE. It needs this today.
 *   - A TEXT LAYER names a third party's engine in its own /Info (D-251, and
 *     CPDF-9 measured ABBYY FineReader in 3 of 14 recent Legistar attachments).
 *     Nothing here measured it, and `null` says so.
 *   - AN EXTERNAL SERVICE RETRAINS UNDER AN UNCHANGED NAME — DEC-35's own
 *     argument against Textract, and the reason a version string alone is not
 *     a fingerprint.
 *
 * So nothing below tests an engine name against a literal, and nothing below
 * knows what a good score is. A SCORE IS A NUMBER THE PROBE PRODUCED; a CAP is
 * a letter from `BASIS_GRADES`, the one vocabulary this project has.
 *
 * ===================================================================== *
 * THE FOUR RULES, each a refusal below and an arm in the suite
 * ===================================================================== *
 *
 * 1. A CALIBRATION IS A MEASUREMENT, NEVER A CLAIM. It carries the probe that
 *    ran, the inputs that probe was given, and the scores that came back. A
 *    calibration with no probe run is REFUSED (`CAL_NO_PROBE`), and the refusal
 *    names the rule rather than the field: a vendor's changelog, a release
 *    note, a model card and a version bump are all CLAIMS, and CLAUDE.md ranks
 *    a claim below a measurement everywhere else in this system too.
 *
 *    THIS IS THE RULE THE ANNOUNCEMENT WATCH EXISTS UNDER, and it is why the
 *    watch can only ever accelerate. See rule 4.
 *
 * 2. THE DRIFT HANDLER IS ASYMMETRIC, and this is the half a build session
 *    would not derive (D-183 says so in as many words). A calibration that
 *    measures WORSE means every leg resting on the old cap now OVERCLAIMS, so
 *    it raises a RE-EVALUATION OBLIGATION naming exactly the transcriptions
 *    bound to the superseded measurement — and RE-GRADES NOTHING. A calibration
 *    that measures BETTER raises NOTHING AT ALL, because a grade rises only by
 *    an authored act (DEC-4: no machine mints a grade).
 *
 *    SILENT RE-GRADING IN EITHER DIRECTION IS THE DEFECT. Not one direction.
 *    Both. An automatic downgrade is a machine minting a grade just as much as
 *    an automatic upgrade is, and it would ALSO be wrong on the facts: what a
 *    worse calibration establishes is that the engine's output is worth less
 *    than the record says, which is a reason for a MEMBER to look at those
 *    transcriptions, not a new letter to stamp on them. The obligation names
 *    them; a person decides.
 *
 * 3. THE OBLIGATION IS DERIVED, NEVER STORED — REC-17's shape, and for REC-17's
 *    two reasons exactly. A stored "needs re-evaluation" bit goes stale in BOTH
 *    directions (still set after the member looked; still clear after the
 *    engine moved again), and the member decides rather than the plane. So
 *    `driftObligations` is a pure function of the calibrations and the chains
 *    that reference them, computed on read and written nowhere.
 *
 * 4. AN ANNOUNCEMENT WATCH MAY ONLY SHORTEN THE INTERVAL TO THE NEXT PROBE.
 *    It may never stand IN for one, and it may never itself change a grade.
 *    `nextProbeDue` takes the signals and can only ever return an instant at or
 *    BEFORE the cadence's own — never after — and that direction is computed
 *    here rather than trusted, because the plausible mistake is a well-meaning
 *    "no announcement, so nothing changed, so push the probe out". ABSENCE OF
 *    AN ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT EVIDENCE OF NO CHANGE. A silent retrain under an
 *    unchanged version string is the exact failure DEC-35 named.
 *
 * ===================================================================== *
 * THE CADENCE, AND WHAT IT COSTS THE GROUP THAT INSTALLS THIS
 * ===================================================================== *
 *
 * `CALIBRATION_CADENCE_MS` is THIRTY DAYS, and it is a DECLARED CONSTANT
 * REVISABLE BY MEASUREMENT rather than a tuning knob: nobody has yet measured
 * how fast a derivation engine actually drifts, so monthly is a CHOSEN starting
 * point, recorded as chosen. When somebody measures the real drift interval,
 * this number moves and the reason moves with it.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS, stated here and in SCHEDULER.md so no group discovers it as a
 * surprise: ONE PROBE PER ENGINE PER CADENCE, on the INSTANCE'S OWN ACCOUNT,
 * against the free allocation. Not one per document, not one per capture, and
 * not a vendor account — the distribution model puts a sovereign instance in
 * each group's own Cloudflare account (D-115's class), so a calibration that
 * needed somebody else's key would not be a capability this project can ship.
 *
 * AND THE CONSUMER SELF-TERMINATES. An instance with no calibratable engine
 * registered holds NO ALARM AT ALL — `wake` is null — which is the property
 * REC-1 prized and the one the Free tier the installer targets is paid for. An
 * idle instance's cost for this feature is exactly zero.
