/* public-read — the door's half of the public read path (requirements: `build/requirements/public-read.md` R1, R4, R5,
 * R9, R10, R18, R21). Moved from `src/index.mjs` (the legacy-index map's §4.4 move, K649 (7); §12.2): the `verify` and
 * `publishedmanifest` arms, the REC-22 note, and the `publishedcase`/`publishedbytes` dispatch line, which hands both
 * to the Worker's `publishedRoutes` (`../publication/worker.mjs`, this module's by `paths`, K697, K702).
 * `bindPublishedPlane`'s hook hand-over stays the door's.
 *
 * `publicReadDoorOp(op, url, env, stub, helpers)` answers one of its seven ops, or null for any other, so the door
 * asks it and goes on. `helpers` are the door's own (`control-plane`'s, later in the order, handed in as
 * `capturePublicOp` is): `json`, `requiredArgument`, `storeSilent`, `storeRefusal`, `doAnswer`; and, optionally,
 * `publicReads`, the names of the registered reads the door routes as ops of their own (R18).
 *
 * R18: A REGISTERED PUBLIC READ is reached as `op=publicread&name=<name>`, or as `op=<name>` when the door names it in
 * `publicReads` (op-declarations declares it `classes: null`; `control-plane` R45 routes it), both through
 * `publicReadDoorRead`. Either way it is served as the four ops above are, under R10's terms: from the published store
 * the door hands in (`stub`, pinned to `bio`), with no credential. No header is forwarded, and of the query only the
 * parameters that carry neither a credential nor a stamp; the store side then hands the read only those it declared.
 *
 * R21: THE DOCKET AND ITS FEED, `op=docketpublic&case=<case>` and `op=docketfeed&case=<case>`, through
 * `publicReadDoorDocket`, under the same terms: the published store the door hands in, no credential, and of the query
 * only `case`, and for the docket `captures=omit` (R25), forwarded only when it is exactly that. */

     byte either op can reach comes from the published projection —
     published_bundles, published_shas, published_edges, and the PUBLISHED
     bucket, which the ratification act is the only writer of. The fence is
     structural in two independent layers (a table set and a bucket
     boundary), so it does not depend on a predicate being remembered. That
     is the property this module's R10 states those tables are read for, and REC-30's
     sweep classifies both ops as deliberately ungated for exactly it.

     PINNED TO `bio`, like op=verify and op=publishedmanifest below: an
     instance has ONE published record. A probe's `scratch` namespace has its
     own Durable Object and its own PUBLISHED prefix and is therefore NOT
