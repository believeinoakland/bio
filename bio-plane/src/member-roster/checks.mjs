 * is membership's (`src/membership/checks.mjs` MEMBERSHIP_CHECKS, minted at one site, `notAnAdmin`; K408 (4)):

 * NO_SUCH_KEY and BAD_STATUS are NOT given rows: the surface sends only keys the plane listed to it (no signer row
 * is ever deleted) and only the two statuses the ops take, so it cannot receive them; EXPERTISE_IS_NOT_ASSIGNED
 * likewise, because the surface never sends `expertise`. NO_SUCH_MEMBER has its row since T38 (N793, K231): it is
