 * description, the Home mark, the viewer's spelling, the one list of module order, and the refusals and listener slots
 * every later module registers through. It reads no bundle and no project.
 *
 * Requirements: build/requirements/member-roster.md (R1–R75). A new module, split by copy from `membership` at T51
 * (T51-145; K624, K657, K1043, K3268, K3946; the split map is build/extraction/membership-split-T51.md). The code and the
 * comments are `membership`'s, moved as they stood: a requirement id a comment cites without a module's name is the id
 * `membership` held (the requirements file maps each old id to its new one, "was membership R<old>"). Until
 * `membership`'s CR-4 swaps it in, nothing composes this module: its refusal rows are not exported from here and not
 * registered with the row census (one code, one site: R68), and its tables are not declared with record-core (R55, R66).
 *
 * SHAPE (K61). `membersOf(ctx)` answers the one instance for a Durable Object's storage, over `ctx.storage.sql` and
 * nothing else (R74); it reaches no record-core, reads no `bundles` table and no project table, and `memberList` is given
 * the projects of a member by its caller (R71). The tables, the exempt list and the declared rows it owns are exported
 * from `schema.mjs`, for the composition that declares them.

       handle together"), and it is a PROJECTION rather than a refusal, because
       the same section says "Members and the public see handles". A member
       legitimately needs this roster — the participant list of a project, the
       author of a promotion, the attestor of a ratification — so the answer is
       the handle roster with the pairing withheld, never a closed door.
       D-157, MEASURED 2026-08-02: before this, an ordinary member's session and
       the shared MEMBER_TOKEN each received `handle` AND `cover` for every
       member, byte-identical to the administrator's view, while three comments
       in this source said the op was admin-only.

       THE STAKE, said here because this is the line that keeps it. schema.mjs
       on `members.cover`: the cover-and-handle split exists precisely so that a
       roster seized or subpoenaed does not deanonymise the group. A handle is
       already public — the record shows it. A cover is the administrator's
       private label for a person. Either one alone is inert; TOGETHER they are
       the map from the public record back to the people in it, and withholding
       that map from everyone who is not an administrator is the whole mechanism.
       This is the rare defect whose blast radius is OUTSIDE the project: the
       people in the roster are the ones it costs.

       `cover` is therefore NOT SELECTED for a caller who does not administer.
       The key is ABSENT from the row, not null and not blank — a key that is
       present and empty still confirms to whoever is asking that a pairing
       exists to be compelled.

       FAIL CLOSED. `administer` is stamped by the CONTROL PLANE from the
       credential that authenticated (control-plane, beside the D-15 viewer stamp)
       and is never taken from the request, the same impostor rule `viewer`,
       `author`, `by` and `owner` follow. Anything that is not the affirmative
       stamp — absent, blank, a caller's invention, a direct-DO route that
       forgot it — yields the handle roster, so a bypass of the stamp loses the
       pairing rather than leaking it. */
