/* The DOCX registry entry (I7, QUEUE COFF-4) — the first office format on the
 * FORMAT axis, built on ooxml.mjs's container primitives.
 *
 * WHAT IT EMITS (I2, plus the shared evidentiary envelope — IC-2):
 *
 *   structure(parts) ->
 *     { ok:true, container:"docx", paragraphs:<int>,
 *       links:[ LinkRecord... ],           // the SAME partitions HTML and PDF
 *       counts:{anchor,intra,deferred,refused,undetermined},   // use, wrapped
 *       evidentiary:{ ... },               // IC-2 — the extras a rendered form
 *       notes:[...] }                      //        of the document destroys
 *
 *   - word/_rels/document.xml.rels `TargetMode="External"` -> deferred/refused,
 *     wrapped by importing subresources.mjs's ONE `linkWrapper` — the parity
 *     property pdfstructure.test.mjs pins for PDF is pinned here for DOCX the
 *     same way, so FRAMEWORK consumes all three containers through one path.
 *   - `<w:hyperlink w:anchor>` -> bookmark -> `anchor` (an internal reference
 *     the way a PDF GoTo is); an anchor naming a bookmark the body does not
 *     define is a STATED undetermined, never an invented target.
 *   - word/embeddings/* -> `intra`, content-addressed by sha256 exactly as a
 *     PDF's embedded files are.
 *   - An unreadable .rels part or embedding is CARRIED as an undetermined
 *     LinkRecord naming the part and why — dropped structure is invented
 *     structure's quieter sibling, and both are forbidden.
 *
 *   ELEMENT REFERENCES are `{kind:"doc-para", ref:"¶<1-based>", para:<0-based>,
 *   run:<0-based, optional>}` per IC-1 as RESOLVED: a DOCX has no pages in its
 *   bytes (pagination is a render-time artifact), so the body's `<w:p>`
 *   sequence — every `<w:p>` in document order, including inside tables — is
 *   the honest anchor. `run` appears only when the reference genuinely targets
 *   runs (a hyperlink, a tracked change); run boundaries are producer
 *   artifacts, and the paragraph is what a person is shown.
 *
 *   text(parts) -> { ok:true, container:"docx", document, paragraphs:[
 *     {para, ref, text} ], undetermined:[Marker...], counts:{chars,
 *     undetermined} } — `<w:t>` runs in body order. A DOCX has no pages, so
 *   the per-unit list is `paragraphs`, not PDF's `pages` (the degenerate form
 *   I2's residual anticipated; stated in IC-2). Deleted text (`w:delText`)
 *   is NOT in the text stream — it is not what a reader of the served
 *   document sees — it lives in the evidentiary envelope as the SUPERSEDED
 *   WORDING. Inserted text (`w:ins` > `w:t`) IS in the stream: it is part of
 *   the document as served.
 *
 *   THE EVIDENTIARY CORE (DEC-5). Tracked changes and comments are evidence a
 *   published PDF of the same document is specifically designed to remove:
 *     { kind:"tracked-change", change:"insertion", author, date, text, source }
 *     { kind:"tracked-change", change:"deletion",  author, date,
 *       superseded, source }                  // the wording that was removed
 *     { kind:"comment", id, author, date, initials, text, source }
 *     { kind:"core-properties", creator, lastModifiedBy, revision, ... }
 *   under ONE envelope `evidentiary` shared by the office entries (IC-2):
 *     { container, kinds:[...], items:[...], undetermined:[{part,why}...],
 *       counts:{<kind>:n} }
 *   Absent attributes are null, never invented; an unreadable comments.xml is
 *   a STATED `{part, why}` in the envelope's own `undetermined`.
 *
 * DETECTION — the confidence ladder, decided deliberately (COFF-1's note):
 *   - bytes: ZIP magic + a READABLE central directory + BOTH
 *     `[Content_Types].xml` and `word/document.xml` present -> "likely". Not
 *     "certain": certainty needs the OPC content-type declaration, which is
 *     DEFLATED and so out of reach of the registry's synchronous detect;
 *     `parts()` runs the full async `discriminate()` and tells the truth.
 *   - a bare `PK\x03\x04` sniff (the acquire-time 1 KiB seam: no EOCD, no
 *     central directory) answers NULL — a renamed plain ZIP is not a .docx,
 *     so ZIP magic alone never claims one. The acquire stamp honestly reads
 *     `undetermined` for OOXML captures until a read-time consult sees the
 *     whole container.
 *   - content type alone: the exact .docx MIME type -> "likely" (the
 *     registry's second pass; a declared type is at most likely, per I7).
 *
 * SIZE GUARD: the DECLARED UNCOMPRESSED bytes of the text parts we would inflate
 * (word/document.xml + word/comments.xml, summed from the central directory —
 * the COFF-6 metric) are what this entry may hold in memory at once, up to
 * ooxml.mjs's bound. Over it, up to its STREAMED_TEXT_BOUND_BYTES, the body is
 * READ IN PIECES (R35, F7): inflated in windows and walked by the same two
 * walks that read a small one, fed a piece at a time, so the part is never
 * held; the tables' `cells` (N724) are not made (`cells` is null) and the
 * answer says it was read in pieces (`piecewise`). Over the streamed ceiling
 * full text extraction is refused as a STATED text-undetermined carrying the
 * marker, its size and `final: true`. Container walk, rels and
 * core-properties still run; nothing is silently truncated. Every part read
 * at all passes ooxml.mjs's part cap (R12, F18): a refusal names its limit
 * where that part's failure is stated.
 *
 * ACTIVE CONTENT (R32, K1888): `structure()` and `text()` carry `active`,
 * what in the file can act when opened (a VBA project, ActiveX and OLE parts,
 * embedded files, external relationship targets), found and read, never run;
 * `activeContent` below is the one builder the three OOXML entries share. The
 * macro-enabled flavours (.docm, .dotm) read as this entry with `variant` set
 * (R33).
 *
 * This module ASSERTS nothing about meaning (FRAMEWORK's, through I2) and
 * WRITES nothing. Never invent structure: everything unreadable is stated.

 *
 *  `rows` is the table's own `<w:tr>` count (a nested table's rows are its
 *  own, which the open-table stack keeps apart). `cols` is the declared grid
 *  — the `<w:gridCol>` count in the table's `<w:tblGrid>` — because a merged
 *  cell (`w:gridSpan`) makes a row's `<w:tc>` count SMALLER than the grid, and
 *  bounding by it would refuse a true address. Where a producer wrote no grid
 *  the widest row's cell count is used, which can only UNDER-state a merged
 *  table's width; that residue is stated here rather than discovered. A
 *  figure this walk could not establish is NULL, never 0.
 *

 *  `walkDocumentBody` numbers them (every `<w:p>` read, as it opens), so the
 *  caller takes their text from that walk and the two cannot disagree. A
 *  paragraph belongs to the innermost cell open around it: a nested table's
 *  paragraphs are its own table's cells', never the outer cell's. A row's
 *  first cell sits after its `w:gridBefore` columns, and each cell moves the
 *  next by its `w:gridSpan`. A MERGED cell is one entry at its first grid
 *  position: a `w:vMerge` continuation joins the restart above it in the same
 *  column, a legacy `w:hMerge` continuation the cell before it in the row,
 *  each bringing its paragraphs (in practice empty) so no text is dropped; a
