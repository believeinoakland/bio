/* review — the review copy (requirements: `build/requirements/review.md`; BIO_Publication_v0_1.md §6A, DEC-31, DEC-72):
 * a draft of a case a project's editors prepare, shown inside the instance to members with standing and to named
 * recipients through a revocable, read-and-comment grant, marked as not a publication, as complete as a publication
 * would be, and naming what a publication would still refuse. It never publishes, signs, or leaves the instance (R20):
 * publishing stays ONE irreversible act, and a review copy stands BESIDE it.
 *
 * Extracted from the legacy modules (T8, layer 8; K3, K102): `store.mjs` (REC-126's review copy: `reviewAct` with
 * `#caseDraft`, `#reviewGrant` and `#reviewRevoke`, the draft identity and edition helpers, `#reviewGates`,
 * `#draftPublisher`, the grant and sight predicates, `#reviewLastChange`, `reviewCopy`, `reviewComment`; REC-198's
 * `caseDraftList`; the six dispatch entries), the check catalogue (C-87 and C-32.16, now `./checks.mjs`) and `schema.mjs`
 * (`case_drafts`, `review_grants`, `review_comments`, now `./schema.mjs`). The legacy code's comments moved with it,
 * shortened where they only restated the code.
 *
 * THE THREE OBJECTS (§6A):
 *   - THE DRAFT CASE (§6A.4, gap 3) is the production. It holds the arguments `op=publish` would take and is identified
 *     BEFORE any gate runs, because `publishCase` refuses an incomplete case and a review copy must not be refused for
 *     exactly the gaps it is sent to show. It is MUTABLE (Bob, 2026-09-17: "An editor must be able to edit").
 *   - THE GRANT (§6A.2) is a scoped, revocable, read-and-comment capability over ONE draft, bound to ONE case edition,
 *     attributed to its issuer and its recipient. Its read secret is generated at the control plane and this module is
 *     handed only the SHA-256 (R21): nothing here can print a secret because nothing here has ever held one.
 *   - THE COMMENT is attributed, and a recipient's is a RECIPIENT's.
 *
 * WHO MAY AUTHOR A DRAFT, ISSUE A GRANT AND REVOKE ONE (R2; §6A.2 as BOB #15 decided it, 2026-09-18, built by REC-133):
 *   - AUTHOR: the project's EDIT permission (membership's `isProjectEditor`). The draft is the production, and editing
 *     it is editing. Its capability half, `contribute`, is checked at the control plane, where capabilities live.
 *   - ISSUE: the project OWNER only, NO administrator arm. Sending unratified material outside the group is the same
 *     kind of act as publishing, and DEC-72 makes publishing the owner's.
 *   - REVOKE: the project OWNER only. Administrators "audit everything and direct nothing" (Membership v2 §4); a grant
 *     outliving its owners is handled by §7.13: an administrator adds an owner, and that owner revokes.
 * No two-person rule: none is ruled, and inventing one would be a fence tighter than its rule. A machine is refused by
 * name (R1): an addressed act is attributed to a person.
 *
 * REACHED as `reviewOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host (the Durable Object's `ctx`), created on the first call
 * with `deps`, returned to every later caller. At creation it creates its tables, declares them to record-core's purge
 * (R24, K23), and fills publication's review provider (publication R23), because `publication` and `case-authoring`
 * come earlier in the order and call the draft door, the grant door, the live grant and the dead answer back.
 * `deps` (each reached through its factory on the same host unless given; a test passes its own):
 *   record, membership   layer 2: `transact`, `mintOpaqueId`, `seedMintLedger`, `declarePurge` (and record-core's
 *                        module-level `mintExhausted`, its R62; R27); `isProjectEditor`,
 *                        `isProjectOwner`, `projectOwners`, `existenceAct`, `viewerPredicate`.
 *   strength             `projectBar` (its R14; R11's `required_strength`).
 *   basisVersions        `testimonyReach` (its R39; R16).
 *   publication          `registerReviewProvider` (its R23).
 *   caseTensions         `attributionInForce` (its R6, was publication R39; R16), read directly and never through
 *                        `publication`, which no longer answers it (its R61; T35-60, N597, K1643).
 *   caseAuthoring        `publishCase` (its R18; R13), run dry.
 *   caseInputs           `statementAcknowledgements` (its R2; R15, R28; `case-authoring`'s R20 before T47, N908), the
 *                        one acknowledgement list, whose answer carries its `withheld_stated` sentence; on the one
 *                        instance for the host (`caseInputsOf`, its R16).
 *   caseAccount          `registerReviewComments` (its R7; was case-authoring R66, retired), filled at start with
 *                        R33's `reviewCommentsFor` (K2483; T42-23a, N839, K2608), on the one instance for the host.
 *   ratification         `registerApprovalReader` (its R50), filled at start with R30–R31's rule and approvals (R32).
 *   caseGrammar          `reviewCommentsOf` (its R25), the comments a signed document carries (R33's left-out read);
 *                        `approvalSubjectSha` (its R26; K2528), the digest an approval names (R31).
 *   now                  the clock for the instants it writes, an ISO string (default: the wall clock, to the ms).
 *
 * READ CONTRACTS it joins in its own SQL: record-core's `bundles` (`bundle_id`, `object_type`, `current_state`) and
 * `files` (`bundle_id`, `path`, `content`), its R37 (R12's findings, R19's project); publication's `cases`
 * (`case_id`, `project_id`), `published_cases` (`case_id`, `edition`, `scope`), `published_case_members` (`case_id`,
 * `edition`, `ord`, `bundle_id`, `role`; R39's starting point) and `case_documents` (`case_id`, `edition`,
 * `doc_sha`, `text`, `draft_id`, `sig_armored`), its R40 (R3, R5, R31, R33, R39).
 *
 * READ CONTRACT it states (R26): `case_drafts` (`draft_id`, `case_id`, `project_id`, `params`, `statement_by`,
 * `created_at`), on record-core R37's terms, which `case-inputs`' statement writer (its R3) reads under
 * `REVIEW_LIST_MAX`; every write to it stays here. */
