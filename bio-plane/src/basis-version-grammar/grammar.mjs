/** PL-1 / IS-1 — the version block's grammar, at BOTH gates through one function.
 *
 *  THE AUTHORED SHAPE IS THREE SIBLING ARRAYS joined by the version's NAME:
 *
 *      basis_versions[]        one row per version  (name, description,
 *                              relationship, state, derived_from, hidden,
 *                              claim, run, author, at, regroup_*)
 *      basis_version_grounds[] one row per (version, ground) with its
 *                              attribution — REC-45's act at the version's grain
 *      basis_version_legs[]    one row per leg, carrying `version` and `ground`
 *
 *  and that is `basis[]`/`grounds[]`'s own idiom one level up rather than a new
 *  one. It is also what the restricted frontmatter grammar can actually express:
 *  the parser reads arrays of objects with SCALAR properties, so a version
 *  carrying its legs as a nested array would not parse at all — measured against
 *  `parseFrontmatter` before the shape was chosen, not assumed.
 *
 *  TWO BOUNDS STATED RATHER THAN SILENTLY VIOLATED, both standing decisions of
 *  the record this item does not get to move:
 *
 *  1. **CORRECTED 2026-09-14 BY REC-84, AND THE OLD RULE IS QUOTED RATHER THAN
 *     DELETED because a superseded rule is corrected with its reason.** This
 *     bound read: *"D-164 IS UNLANDED, so a version's legs address WHOLE
 *     BUNDLES. There is no extent, no offset and no extraction method on a
 *     version leg, because the record cannot express one yet … when D-164 lands,
 *     the field arrives here with a writer rather than as a nullable column that
 *     reads like a precision the record never had."* D-164 landed: IC-83 (the
 *     `content` table and its writer, REC-82) and IC-84 (this grammar, REC-84).
 *     **The prediction held exactly** — `inquiry_basis_version_legs.content_id`
 *     arrived NULLABLE AND WITHOUT ITS WRITER at REC-82, deliberately, and the
 *     writer is REC-84's. A version leg may now carry an `extent` (IC-1's union,
 *     flattened onto the leg by `legExtent`) or name a part outright by
 *     `content_id`; absent, it means the whole document and NOT `unstated`
 *     (Bob's 5.3). The grammar is `checkLegExtentGrammar`, shared with
 *     `basis[]`'s own loop, and it fires here as C-25.10.
 *  2. **D-184 / C-2.8 bound the leg vocabulary to information or inquiry.** Not
 *     projects, not actions, not entities — C-25.10 refuses everything else by
 *     name, at the version's own grain, because a version's legs do not pass
 *     through `checkInquiryBasis`'s loop over `basis[]`.
 *
 *  AND A THIRD BOUND, on what is NOT checked here: the transitive basis DAG. A
 *  version leg naming this inquiry is refused (C-25.14) because that is a fact
 *  about one document, but a leg naming an inquiry that transitively rests on
 *  this one is a cycle only the STORE can see, and it is refused at `basis[]` by
 *  `#basisCyclePath` at the moment a version's legs become the basis. That is
 *  IS-2's accept path and it was not built; PL-1 records the edge rather than
 *  half-building a second cycle walk that would drift from the first. Built
 *  since: the accept refuses it through `inquiry`'s one walk, `cyclePath`
 *  (`VERSION_BASIS_CYCLE`, C-25.27, R12).
 *
 *  VERSION LEGS ARE DELIBERATELY *NOT* REQUIRED IN `references[]`, which is the
 *  one place this diverges from `basis[]`'s rules (C-6.3). `references[]` is what
 *  the INQUIRY points at; `refs` is its projection and the re-evaluation walk
 *  reads it. A SUGGESTED alternative account is not the inquiry's stance, and
 *  requiring its legs in `references[]` would let any machine suggestion silently
 *  expand the inquiry's own edge set — and with it the reverse index, the
 *  re-evaluation obligation and the cycle surface — before a member had accepted
 *  anything. The protection a reader actually needs is that the target EXISTS,
 *  and the store supplies it: promote resolves every version leg against
 *  `bundles` and refuses one that points at nothing, which is the resolve-or-refuse
 *  posture `action_basis` and `supersedes` already take.

       decided (PL-17), so a fourth state added there reaches this arm without
       this arm being edited — the REC-46 lesson taken a second time.

       THE LICENCE, AND ITS EXACT BOUND. DEC-65 (answered 2026-08-09) permits a
       version that declares EXACTLY ONE part to carry the explicit no-claim
       value in this field, and nothing wider. The arithmetic is the whole
       argument: with one part there is no MAXIMUM to take, so §12 derives the
       same conservative weakest-leg answer whether or not anybody asserted
       independent sufficiency — no member is credited with a structural claim
       they did not make, and DEC-32's default is what you get either way. With
       TWO parts the maximum is live, and an unclaimed part in that maximum is
       precisely the finding-made-stronger-by-nobody this rule exists to refuse.
       So the second case is refused BY NAME below rather than falling through.

       WHAT IS *NOT* LICENSED, stated because a reader will reach for it: a
       MACHINE'S STAMP is still refused on a single-part version. The licence is
       for the record saying `nobody claimed this` OUTRIGHT, never for the record
       saying `a machine claimed this` — those are different findings and the
       second is the overclaim DEC-65 was raised about. A BLANK is still refused
