/* attestation — co-attestation and the instance's own key (requirements: `build/requirements/attestation.md`). It asks
 * the timestamp authorities `signatures` names for a trusted timestamp over a capture's hash, and on request a
 * co-archive of its locator (R1–R3); it answers every attestation the record holds for a capture (R7); and it holds the
 * instance's signing key, which signs this instance's receipt for an archive-sourced capture (R4) and the statements
 * later modules ask it to sign (R5, R6). A timestamp proves that the bytes existed at an instant. It never proves where
 * they came from, and never the credibility of their content.
 *
 * Split from `provenance` with N512 (K617, K1193; T25; `build/plan/draft-T25-splits.md` P-2), with no change of
 * meaning: from its `index.mjs`, `attest` and `attestStatus` with their header, `RECEIPT_KIND`, `STATEMENT_KIND`,
 * `instanceStatement`, `attestationsOf` and the receipt block (`receiptStatement`, the key, `signReceipt`,
 * `instanceSign`, `instanceKeyBound`, `instanceKeys`, `signedReceipts`, the `signingKey` option); C-89 from its
 * `checks.mjs` (now `./checks.mjs`); `receipt_keys` and `signed_receipts` from its `schema.mjs` (now `./schema.mjs`);
 * `attestOp` from its `ops.mjs` (now `./ops.mjs`). Provenance R31–R34, R56, R57, R49 and R39 are R1–R7 and R8 here.
 * The comments moved with the code; where one named a provenance requirement that moved, it names this module's.
 *
 * REACHED as `attestationOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host (the Durable Object's `ctx`), created on the first
 * call with `deps` and returned to every later caller. At creation it creates its tables and declares them to
 * record-core's purge (`receipt_keys` exempt, `signed_receipts` keyed to no bundle; R10).
 * `deps`:
 *   record, provenance  the modules it uses, `recordOf(host)` and `provenanceOf(host)` unless a test passes its own.
 *   now           the module's clock, an ISO instant (default: the wall clock); a key's `first_used` and a receipt's
 *                 `signed_at` read it.
 *   instanceName  the instance's name in its receipts (R4), default `unnamed`.
 *   signingKey    the instance's receipt-signing key (R4, K59): an Ed25519 private key, PKCS#8, base64; held as a
 *                 secret by the operator and replaceable. Absent or unreadable, no key is bound (R6): `signReceipt`
 *                 and `instanceSign` answer `RECEIPT_NO_KEY`, and `instanceKeyBound` false. */

         alone, and the bytes are not called absent either: CAPTURE_HELD_IN_PARTS.
