/* screens-intake: bringing material in and deciding what enters the record (N897 (1); draft-T46-interface.md §2.4).
 * Five registry screens, `capture`, `held`, `archive` (since T47), `open-file` and `inbox`, each met to interface-shell's screen contract (its
 * R21): `{id, reads, render, acts, words}`. Pure: it reads no table and writes nothing; every read and act is an op the
 * plane serves, called through the kit.
 *
 * The contract is interface-shell R21's (K2996, K2998): every function is self-contained (its parameters, the kit `cs`
 * and the language's own globals), so the shell composes the page's one script from their text and the same functions
 * run in node for the tests. `reads(view)` answers `{name: {op, query, empty?}}`; `render(cs, view)` the screen's HTML;
 * each act `{op, label, send(view, el, cs, extra), done?(view, answer, cs), rereads?, refusals?, dialog?}`. It also
 * reads the parts K2999 and K3002 added to R21: `cs.download(op, {query, body})`, a byte answer handed to the browser
 * as a file (R6); `cs.digest(text)`, the SHA-256 of a text (the bundle an acquire promotes, R1); `cs.now()`; a `send`
 * answering a promise; `extra.picked`, the picked rows' keys; and `{refuse: key, fills}`, a word of the list beside the act.
 *
 * Words by key (R26; K3366, K3368; DEC-257, DEC-258): this module holds no member-facing English. `words` is the keys of
 * `setup-words`' `WORD_ROWS` each screen draws, and the shell reads every sentence through them. */
