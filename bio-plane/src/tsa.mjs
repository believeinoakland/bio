/* RFC 3161 trusted timestamps: the primary co-attestation.
 *
 * Why this is primary and the public archive is not. A timestamp authority
 * receives a HASH and nothing else. It learns no locator, so it cannot tell what
 * the group is reading, which under Design Requirement 13 is the difference
 * between an attestation and a disclosure. It needs no account, so there is no
 * credential to rotate or leak. And the token it returns verifies offline
 * against the authority's own certificate for as long as that chain is
 * checkable, by anyone, with `openssl ts -verify` and no BIO code.
 *
 * What it proves and what it does not. A self-recorded hash proves integrity
 * since capture: it is the group's own claim about what the source served. A
 * timestamp proves the capture EXISTED at the claimed instant, which is the part
 * the group cannot fabricate for itself. Intake Doctrine Section 3: an attacker
 * holding a write token "can fabricate plausible provenance fields, but cannot
 * backdate a third-party archive snapshot or forge a timestamp token against its
 * issuing authority".
 *
 * The endpoints are a COMPILED CONSTANT, never member input. This module makes
 * the plane send an outbound request, and a list a caller could supply would
 * turn every instance into a probe of whatever an attacker named. The evidence
 * locator fence exists for member-supplied addresses; this one is not
 * member-supplied at all, which is a stronger guarantee than validating it
 * would be. Note that these are http rather than https on purpose: the TSA
 * protocol carries its own signatures and transport encryption adds nothing to
 * a signed token, which is why the RFC's own examples are http.
 *
 * Verification is deliberately NOT done here. Checking a token means parsing
 * CMS, validating a certificate chain, and deciding which roots to trust, and a
 * Worker that got any of that subtly wrong would be worse than one that does not
 * claim to have done it. The doctrine already places this at review: "Co-
 * attestation earns its weight only if someone checks it." What this module does
 * guarantee is BINDING: the returned token contains the digest we asked about,
 * so a TSA cannot hand back a token for something else and have it recorded as
 * ours.
