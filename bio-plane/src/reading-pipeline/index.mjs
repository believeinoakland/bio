   provenance, its container, its dialect and its text units; and the pieces of it `extraction`'s re-read (its

   took from the plane's old `index.mjs`), with the reasons kept where the reason is the code's; the rows applied here
   are named at their sites. It is pure: no record, no table, no catalogue row. It fetches nothing about the source:
   the bytes come from the evidence store the caller hands in (R24), and tiers 2 and 3 are reached only through their
   bindings with the capture's digest (R16). R32 (T49) gives text read as text through no format entry its text units
   (`textUnitsOfText`; R33, T50: a text with no blank line split at its line breaks), R34 (T50) its `title`. T33-23 adds the opt-in after-read hook (R25–R27, `hooks.mjs`), which
   `read` never reaches. R37 (fix round 4b): a failed reading says whether its cause is `transient` or `final`; the units
   budget binds the acquire answer only; OCR past its per-request pages states its cursor and owes the rest; a whole above
   what the object can hold is never loaded. G68 (fix round 7): a piece after the first of a text or a CSV is read from the
   byte window of the object its cursor names, not from the whole object (R40, `textWindowTick`, `csvWindowTick`), and a PDF
   read in page ranges is kept open between its pieces (pdf-reader's `openPdfRange`, R44; G82: with the turn given back, R45). */

     refusal sends nothing. Through T48 a `transcription` that hands `credentials` and no `accounts` is read the same
     way (`credentials` R72's delegate answers `accountFor` as `ai-accounts` does), until the plane's transcriber
     re-points; the alias is removed in the tranche after (R31);
   - `useCheck`: `ai-use.useCheck` (its R3), asked `{owner, member, use: "transcribe", at}` for the account chosen;
     a refusal, or none handed in, sends nothing (a limit nobody checked is not one the act is within);
   - `transcribe`: the caller's AI path, handed `{account, capture_sha, store, pages, use}`, answering
