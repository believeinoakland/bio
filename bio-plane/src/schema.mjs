-- so no invocation can ever record its own death. Consumption is therefore
-- measured on every real run and the ceiling is found by a stepped probe whose
-- checkpoints survive the kill. peak_ms is the worst single run seen, which is

-- ---- D-104: source reachability, and what may NOT count as a failure ----
-- REC-21: the PERSONAL half of the queue, and it is a SEPARATE TABLE on
-- purpose. The record half of an item's state lives on the EVENT (DEC-16: a
-- task's status, a proposal's disposition), so one member's resolution clears
-- every member's queue. This table holds what must NOT work that way: what one
-- member has chosen not to be told about. Muting is PERSONAL; dismissing is a
-- RECORD ACT; they are never one control (D-125), and keeping them in two
-- tables with two doctrines is how that survives the next person who
-- implements a delete button.
--
-- muted_kinds is a sorted comma-separated set and MAY CONTAIN CONDITION KINDS
-- ONLY. A CONDITION is a fact about our own machinery; an OBLIGATION is
-- something a named person must do for the record to proceed, and tasks
-- carries no per-member mute, so a muted obligation would leave the record
-- believing a question reached a person it cannot reach. The fence is at the
-- ONE write (store.mjs queueMute, over queuestate.mjs's catalogue), because a
-- CHECK constraint here could not name the vocabulary and a second copy of the
-- rule is a second place for it to drift.
--
-- The set is the kinds PRESENT WHEN THE MUTE WAS MADE, which is why this is a
-- set of kinds and not a boolean on the case: a new kind on a muted case is not
-- in the set and still reaches the member.
--
-- snoozed_until is an instant the MEMBER chose. There is no default: P-87 says
-- re-notify at the stage's OWN declared interval and never on a global one, so
-- there is no instance-wide snooze constant anywhere in this plane and a snooze
-- with no instant is refused rather than filled in. last_seen is the anchor a
-- re-notify clock reads.
--
-- case_id IS a bundle id (an inquiry or a project), so this table clears in
-- BOTH purge arms via a DELETE keyed on it (D-113); hygiene.test.mjs holds that
-- against this file.

-- publishes: FINDING::<progression>::<stage> is the key proposal_dispositions
-- already uses, and CONDITION::governor-holding-host::<host> names the host).
-- It is keyed on the MEMBER, so it moves no other member's list, and it writes
-- no disposition: a finding leaves the team's list only by the authored act.
-- item_class is FINDING or CONDITION and never OBLIGATION -- the fence is at
-- the ONE write (store.mjs queueMute) for queue_state's reason. It is personal
-- state, not corpus-derived, and it is keyed on no bundle id, so it clears in

-- THE OBSERVATION LOG (§11). Where the run searched across the four levels,
-- what it established, where it STOPPED and why. APPEND-ONLY: 'seq' is
-- monotonic per run and no row is ever updated, because a resumed run reads its
-- own log and continues (§14b.7) and a log that can be rewritten is not
-- evidence of anything.
--
-- IT IS NEVER WRITTEN INTO bundle.md. §11: "the observation log cannot live in
-- bundle.md, which is written only on success — the log's whole value is the
-- failure path." C-22.6 refuses an entry that names a bundle at the one append
-- site, so the separation is enforced where the write happens rather than
-- asserted about every reader.
--
-- 'state' is D-129's vocabulary and the column is deliberately not an enum in
-- SQL: the refusal is C-22.1 in airun.mjs, where it can NAME the five legal
-- values and say why. A CHECK constraint here would refuse with a SQLite error
-- nobody can translate, which is precisely what DEC-49 exists to prevent.
--
-- 'governed' is D-104's split as a stored fact: 1 means OUR pacing held us,
-- which is a fact about us and never about the source. C-22.2 refuses any
-- definitive state on a governed row.
-- REC-93 / IC-92, 2026-09-14: ai_run_log STOOD HERE AND IS NOW THE
-- observations TABLE further down this file. OBSERVATION-LOG-DESIGN.md
-- section 4.4 folds it: its rows are rows of that table with
-- authority_kind = run, and store.mjs #migrate copies every existing row across
-- and then DROPS the old table. The CREATE is removed rather than left standing
-- because an idempotent create would rebuild an empty ai_run_log on the next
-- boot and put the store straight back into the two-tables state section 4.4
-- forbids -- one fact, two writers, which is the D-164 failure this design
-- names. op=airunlog reads through unchanged, so I3 does not move.
--
-- THE WORDING OF THE LINE ABOVE IS LOAD-BEARING AND IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE: it
-- first read "because CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS would rebuild ...", and
-- hygiene.test.mjs harvests table names out of this file by that exact literal,
-- so the sentence DESCRIBING the removal was itself parsed as a table named
-- "would" and failed the D-113 purge census. Measured, not reasoned -- the scan
-- cannot tell prose from schema, so prose here does not spell the phrase.

${BIAS_SCHEMA}



-- D-266 / IC-60: THE JUDGMENT-LAYER DISPOSITION, AND IT IS A SECOND TABLE
-- RATHER THAN A WIDER PRIMARY KEY ON THE ONE ABOVE -- WHICH IS THE WHOLE ITEM.
--
-- A DISMISSAL IS SCOPED TO THE KEY'S OWN SUBJECT (the ruling, 2026-08-10, made
-- by the repository rather than by Bob). DEC-16's instance-wide clearing is
-- instance-wide BECAUSE ITS SUBJECT IS: a progression-stage finding is a fact
-- about the SHARED record, so one act clearing it under every case is dedup and
-- not judgment-suppression. A STANCE is expressly one project's own property
-- (section 7, D-216), a dismissal is a judgment-layer act, and R5 makes forks at
-- the judgment layer legitimate. So one team's dismissal of a stance-scoped
-- finding governs THAT TEAM'S feed and nothing else -- exactly the boundary
-- store.mjs #findingsStanceDiverged already enforces by refusing to offer
-- op=versioncurrent across projects.
--
-- WIDENING proposal_dispositions' OWN KEY WOULD HAVE ERASED THAT DISTINCTION,
-- and the distinction IS the item. Its key stays (progression_key, stage_key)
-- and stays instance-wide; this table is where the OTHER subject lives. Nothing
-- migrates: no disposition has ever been recorded for the stance-scoped kinds.
--
-- finding_id is the QUEUE ITEM'S OWN id, in the feed's own spelling
-- (FINDING::kind::...), so the act and the feed name one identity written by two
-- producers that never consult each other -- the same pin IC-53 put on the other
-- shape one field over. kind is carried for reading, never keyed on: a list of
-- slugs goes stale the wave a fourth non-derived finding is minted, and the
-- property this act keys on is carrying no progression stage rather than being
-- named in a list.
--
-- Member-authored state, like proposal_dispositions above, and cleared by the
-- WHOLE-STORE arm of op=purge only (it has no bundle_id) -- the D-113
-- silent-leftover, asserted against this file by hygiene.test.mjs.

-- nothing filters on either leading column: op=queue reads this table WHOLE, exactly
-- as proposalsFeed reads the other one, and the upsert seeks the primary key. An index
-- with no statement behind it is an access path built for a question no op asks, which
-- is the finding that ratchet exists to hold. Add one WITH the statement that reads it.
