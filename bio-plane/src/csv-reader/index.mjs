/* The CSV registry entry (QUEUE FW-23) — the ninth format on COFF-1's axis,
 * and the first one on it that is NOT a container.
 *
 * DESIGNED BY BOB #32, 2026-09-24 (`docs/development/OFFICE-FORMATS.md`, "CSV
 * — DESIGNED 2026-09-24"): the delimiter and the encoding are found BY
 * SIGNATURE and RECORDED ON THE READING; when either cannot be determined the
 * reading SAYS SO and nothing is guessed. The file is ONE sheet. Row 1 is row
 * 1 whether or not it looks like a header, because a header is a READING and
 * is never assumed. Cells are addressed with the existing `sheet-cell` /
 * `sheet-range` extent kinds (IC-1, IC-124), 1-based row and column. The
 * reading carries the CAPTURE's grade, because the bytes are the publisher's
 * — so this entry emits no grade of its own anywhere, and `formats-csv.test`
 * asserts that absence rather than leaving it to be noticed.
 *
 * WRITTEN FROM A MEASURED PAGE, NOT FROM THE SPEC. Every decision below was
 * taken against the 166 `.csv` keys of `s3://cao-94612` — all 166 fetched
 * whole, 90,402,768 bytes, 2026-09-24 (M-144). Where the corpus could not
 * answer a question that is SAID, and the question is answered somewhere the
 * corpus is not.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1. DETECTION: FROM THE DECLARED CONTENT TYPE, AND NEVER FROM THE BYTES.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A CSV has no magic bytes. It has a SHAPE — lines that partition into the
 * same number of fields — and the whole finding of this item is that PROSE
 * WEARS THAT SHAPE. Measured both ways, because one direction alone would
 * have been the wrong reading:
 *
 *   - over 198 NON-CSV bodies drawn from the same bucket (8 per extension
 *     over 34 extensions, seed 20260924), the candidate byte signature fired
 *     0 times. That looks like a licence to sniff, and it is NOT one: this
 *     corpus holds ONE `.txt` in 43,283 keys and its text-bearing half is
 *     27,764 PDFs. THE CORPUS CANNOT ANSWER THIS QUESTION — what a signature
 *     would false-positive on is exactly what is missing from it.
 *   - so the question was put to the shapes the corpus lacks, planted: a
 *     hard-wrapped prose paragraph with one comma a line, a minutes list
 *     ("Present: Bas, Fife"), a Markdown table, an apache log, an ini file.
 *     At a two-line minimum, 5 of 8 non-CSV shapes FIRED. At three lines,
 *     prose and the minutes list still fire. Raising the minimum only trades
 *     a false claim for a missed one, because there is nothing to find: three
 *     lines of prose each holding one comma and a three-row two-column CSV
 *     ARE THE SAME BYTES.
 *
 * So `detect(bytes, ...)` returns NULL — always, for any bytes. This is the
 * xlsx entry's own move at its prefix seam ("a bare PK sniff must NOT claim
 * xlsx"), arrived at from the other side: there the bytes are out of reach,
 * here they are in hand and DO NOT SAY. A format claimed from a shape prose
 * can wear is the record claiming more than it can support, which this
 * project holds to be worse than a missing feature.
 *
 * `detect(null, contentType)` answers `likely` for the types that name a CSV
 * or TSV outright — the ceiling the registry's two-pass doctrine fixes for a
 * declared type. A file declared `text/plain`, `application/vnd.ms-excel` or
 * `application/octet-stream` is judged by `isDelimitedText(name, type, head)`
 * (R21), which weighs the name, the type and the head TOGETHER (G130b): the
 * declared type alone names too little of what is on the wire (S-10).
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 2. THE ENCODING — decided per window, the file's by majority (G131a, G131c).
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A body is read in byte windows (header §4). Each window is classified from
 * its own bytes: no byte >= 0x80 is `us-ascii` (every ASCII-grid encoding reads
 * it identically); valid UTF-8 beyond ASCII (a character the window's edge cuts
 * is carried, not invalid) is `utf-8`; bytes that are not UTF-8 are the legacy
 * charset (`windows-1252`, or the one the caller declared); and bytes no legacy
 * charset names (a NUL, a byte windows-1252 leaves undefined) are undetermined.
 * A BOM decides the file at `certain`. A body with no BOM whose even or odd
 * bytes are NULs is UTF-16 (`likely`, assumed). The FILE's encoding is the
 * majority of its non-ASCII windows; an all-ASCII file is `us-ascii` at
 * `likely` only, because a later window may differ. A window whose decision
 * differs from the file's is listed in `disagree` and READ under its own.
 *
 * The record walk runs over a BIJECTIVE BYTE TRANSPORT (each byte one code
 * unit U+0000-U+00FF; NOT `TextDecoder("latin1")`, which is windows-1252 and
 * maps 0x80-0x9F elsewhere), so the grid (delimiters, quotes, line breaks are
 * ASCII) is found whatever the high bytes mean, and each field holding a high
 * byte is decoded on its own under its window's encoding: a field the encoding
 * cannot read is `undetermined` with a null value — never mojibake. UTF-16 is
 * decoded as a stream, whole-file.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 3. THE DELIMITER — the majority of the window's records (G131c).
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A candidate (comma, semicolon, tab, pipe) is the delimiter of a window when
 * it occurs the same non-zero number of times, outside quotes, on a MAJORITY
 * of the window's first 1,000 complete records. Records, not lines: a quote
 * opens only at the start of a field, a quoted line break stays inside its
 * record, CR, LF and CRLF all end one. A ragged row, a title block, a quoted
 * newline or CR-only endings therefore do not fail it. Exactly one candidate
 * -> determined; two or more -> tied; none -> none consistent; under two
 * complete records -> too few. The file's delimiter is the most common
 * determined window decision; a window that decided otherwise is read under its
 * own, one that decided nothing under the last decided before it.
 *
 * THE CANDIDATE SET IS A LIST AND THAT IS ITS LIMIT, SAID PLAINLY. A file
 * delimited by anything else reads as one column with the delimiter recorded
 * `undetermined`.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 4. THE GRID, THE BOUNDS, AND WHAT THIS FORMAT CANNOT CARRY.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ONE sheet, named by a CONSTANT (`CSV_SHEET_NAME`) because the file carries
 * no name at all. `rows`/`cols` — the C-45.1 BOUND — are NULL, for `.ods`'s
 * reason exactly: RFC 4180 fixes no maximum. `usedRows`/`usedCols` are measured
 * and emitted beside them. NO LINKS, NO EMBEDDINGS, NO EVIDENTIARY EXTRAS, NO
 * IMAGES — every one of those zeroes is a fact about the FORMAT, not a walk
 * that found nothing, and the notes say which kind of zero it is.
 *
 * THE BOUNDS are runtime-limits' `READ_BOUNDS` rows, taken through `boundOf`
 * with no literal here: the body's bytes (50 MB, the standard's figure for a
 * light kind, K4834), its records (1,048,576) and a record's columns (16,384);
 * a body over any is refused whole, stated with its size and the limit. A body
 * within them is read in 1 MiB byte WINDOWS with a carry of the unfinished
 * field, record, quote, multi-byte character or CRLF, holding about its text
 * and no record list; the pass that counted its records left an access point
 * (a byte, a row) at each window, from which `cellsIn` reads a range without
 * walking from byte 0 (G131e). A cell over 32,767 characters is kept to 1 MiB
 * and stated; a quote left open at the end of the file is stated with the row
 * it opened on and the bytes it covers (G131b).
 *
 * This module asserts nothing about MEANING (FRAMEWORK's, through I2) and
 * WRITES nothing.
