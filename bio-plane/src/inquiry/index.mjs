/* inquiry — the one recursive object of case-making (requirements: `build/requirements/inquiry.md`). A question, which
 * gathers evidence and other inquiries as the legs of its basis, and may reach a conclusion. This module holds the
 * inquiry's lifecycle and its grammar (the public face of `inquiry-grammar`'s rules, `./grammar.mjs`), the basis legs, the
 * ground partition (DEC-32), the exclusions a completeness statement names, supersession and division, dated waits and
 * the documents a question waits on that were set aside (R58).
 * What the record can earn for a leg and which questions rest on a target (the earned registry, the resting-on reads,
 * the cycle walk and `inquiry_basis` with its one write) are `leg-earning`'s since T33 (K617, K1505): this module asks
 * it, and re-exports its names and reads for importers not yet re-pointed (plan Rules (9) item 4). It holds no version of a basis, no conclusion and no
 * strength: those are `basis-versions`' and `strength`'s, which read what this module holds.
 *
 * Extracted from the legacy modules (T7, layer 6; K3, K64, K83, K102, N55, N56): `store.mjs` (REC-11's basis projection
 * and cycle guard, REC-14's exclusions, REC-16's division, REC-17's live-leg predicate and superseded-by index, REC-18's
 * earned registry with REC-83/REC-88/MK-2's arms, REC-45's grounding, S-11's disposition, REC-82/REC-84's leg content,
 * REC-220's leg versions, REC-173's replay row), `schema.mjs` (the three tables, now `./schema.mjs`). The leg and entry
 * grammar is `inquiry-grammar`'s since T19 (moved from the catalogue, K766), judged at the write synchronously (R11);
 * `./grammar.mjs` is its one public face here. The legacy code's comments moved with it, shortened where they only
 * restated it.
 *
 * REACHED as `inquiryOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host (the Durable Object's `ctx`), created on the first call
 * with `deps`, returned to every later caller. At creation it declares its tables to purge (R36), joins every promotion
 * (R11's check, R12's projection) and every re-read that stales content (content R41's `onStale`), and registers with
 * retrieval the `legs` field's relation (R36, its R62) and the migrated arm of `surfaced_in` (N405, its R56). Its
 * questions' findings are bias's work products (R53, bias R40) through `inquiryFindings`, which `plane` registers.
 * `deps`:
 *   record, membership, promotion, content, connections, entities, retrieval, provenance   the modules it uses,
 *                (connections, entities and provenance are passed through to leg-earning; standards and duties too),
 *                through their factories on the same host unless a test passes its own (connections, entities,
 *                retrieval and provenance are reached lazily, on first use).
 *   bias         the host's bias instance the lens of a finding is read from (R53); else the one `inquiryFindings` binds,
 *                and with neither a finding records no lens. Never created here: the host builds bias with its `env`.
 *   now          the module's clock, an ISO instant at second precision (default: the wall clock). */

  /* REC-16: DIVIDING an inquiry. open|surfaced|concluded -> `divided`, which is
   * TERMINAL (DEC-28), with the parent's legs re-homed onto children that each
   * supersede it.
   *
   * WHY THIS EXISTS AND IS NOT HOUSEKEEPING. Weakest-link composition means an
   * inquiry mixing one well-supported claim with one thin one is worth exactly
   * the thin one. Without division a member's only options are to OVERCLAIM or
   * to STAY SILENT, and both are failures of the same kind this repository's
   * threat model is about. Division is the honest third move: say that the
   * question was two questions, and answer each at what it is actually worth.
   *
   * AND THE ABUSE IS THE SAME MECHANISM (R4), which is why the disclosure below
   * is the point of this act rather than a detail. Dividing would otherwise be a
   * CHEAPER WAY TO SHED A FINDING THAT CUTS AGAINST YOU than severing it: move
   * the inconvenient leg onto a child nobody publishes and the published half
   * looks stronger, with nothing on the record saying what happened. Three
   * things close that, and all three are enforced rather than encouraged:
   *
   *   1. NO LEG MAY BE DROPPED. Every ord in the parent's basis is apportioned
   *      to at least one child, INCLUDING every `cuts_against` leg, and the
   *      refusal names the orphans (NO_APPORTIONMENT). Severance is the act that
   *      removes material and it costs a per-leg reason; division only re-homes,
   *      so it does not do severance's work at a discount (DEC-29(a)).
   *   2. EACH CHILD NAMES ITS PARENT AND EVERY SIBLING, in its own bundle.md, in
   *      the keys REC-14 reserved for exactly this and projected through the
   *      ordinary promote path. A reader who can see one half must be able to
   *      see that the other half EXISTS.
   *   3. THE PARENT RECORDS WHERE EVERY LEG WENT, in `division_apportionment`,
   *      and the catalog's `divided` entry requirements refuse the state without
   *      it — so a hand-written document cannot wear `divided` while quietly
   *      losing a leg.
   *
   * ONE AUTHORED REASON FOR THE WHOLE DIVISION (DEC-29(a)), and NO per-leg
   * reason. The per-leg judgement is already recorded per leg, in the
   * apportionment; a second one would be friction theatre on an act whose
   * disclosure is already total. Do not add one by inference.
   *
   * AUTHOR-SCOPED, SETTLED (DEC-30): any `contribute` holder, act attributed. A
   * machine credential is refused BY SHAPE (MACHINE_CANNOT_DIVIDE), the
   * MACHINE_CANNOT_CONCLUDE precedent — a machine may surface a question and may
   * never decide that the group's question was malformed. Owner-scoping was the
   * alternative and was refused for a reason worth keeping here: division is how
   * a member escapes an overclaiming mix, and de-escalation must never require
   * permission from someone whose incentive may run the other way.
   *
   * NO NEW TABLE (decision D5). The division is AUTHORED in bundle.md and the
   * children's `supersedes` edges reach `refs` through the projection that
   * already exists. A division table written by an op would be the first
   * relationship in this record that exists outside the document asserting it.
   *
   * THE MACHINE IS THE CATALOG'S, through vocabFor over the DECLARED spelling,
   * so a legacy focus/problem document — whose own vocabulary has no `divided`
   * — is refused rather than quietly given a state its contract never had. */

  /* ================================================================   * REC-45 / DEC-32: `op=inquiryground` — THE ACT THAT AUTHORS THE STRUCTURE.
   *
   * REC-42 built the partition and both gates that defend it, and left one gap
   * routed rather than closed: NOTHING AUTHORED IT. Grounds reached the record
   * only through a hand-written `bundle.md` promoted by op=promote, so DEC-32
   * clause 6 — *"RESTRUCTURING AFTER SEEING THE STRENGTH IS LEGAL, RECORDED AND
   * ATTRIBUTED — never blocked… the system may NOTICE the pattern"* — was
   * unreachable in both halves at once, because neither RECORDING nor NOTICING
   * is possible without an act that carries a reason. This is that act.
   *
   * IT IS BUILT ON op=publish's STAMPING SHAPE, and the split is the same one:
   *   AUTHORED, caller-supplied, never prefilled — WHICH legs are grouped
   *   together, what each group is called, the optional STATEMENT on a group,
   *   and the REASON for a restructuring. Nothing here proposes a partition,
   *   guesses a label, or moves a leg on a member's behalf.
   *   STAMPED by the server — `asserted_by` and `at` on every group, taken from
   *   the authenticated session and the clock and NEVER from a parameter.
   *
   * AND THE STAMP IS THE POINT OF THE ITEM. REC-42's gate already refuses a
   * MACHINE asserter and an UNDATED assertion; what it cannot refuse is a
   * caller who supplies a well-formed name and a well-formed date belonging to
   * somebody else, or belonging to an hour before the strength was shown. So a
   * caller's `asserted_by`/`at` are DELETED from every row before the stamp
   * (the op=promote `ownerMemberId` precedent, and the reason it is DELETE and
   * not OVERWRITE: overwriting is a property of the code path taken, deletion
   * is a property of the input, and only the second survives somebody later
   * adding an arm). The old process's CLAUDE.md rule (archived,
   * `docs/archive/CLAUDE-2026-09-26-old-process.md`) was exactly this one — a provenance hop a
   * caller can hand us is one a caller can invent — and this is the last door
   * on the one field in the record that makes a finding STRONGER.
   *
   * WHAT COUNTS AS A RESTRUCTURE, and it is decided from the RECORD:
   * the inquiry is in FIRST AUTHORSHIP when its standing document carries NO
   * partition at all — no leg names a group and there is no `grounds` key — and
   * is being RESTRUCTURED in every other case. A reason is REQUIRED on the
   * second and required on neither half of the first; DEC-32's clause is about
   * a member who *"may legitimately realise their structure was wrong"*, and
   * there must be a structure for that to be true of. The distinction is NOT a
   * parameter and must never become one: a caller who could declare "this is my
   * first time" could walk past the reason gate on every restructuring they
   * made. REMOVING a partition is a restructure too, and takes a reason like
   * any other — it changes an authored structure, and the fact that it moves in
   * the conservative direction is a fact about the ANSWER, not about the act.
   *
   * WHAT CARRIES FORWARD AND WHAT IS RE-STAMPED, which is the other half of
   * making clause 6 legible. A group's row asserts that ITS LEGS are enough on
   * their own, so the assertion is ABOUT the legs: a group whose leg set and
   * statement are unchanged keeps the `asserted_by` and `at` it already had,
   * and a group whose membership moved becomes THIS member's assertion, NOW.
   * Re-stamping everything would erase the one thing DEC-32 says the date is
   * for — *"a structure authored after a strength was seen is a different act
   * from one authored before it, and only a date lets a reader tell"* — and
   * carrying everything forward would let a member re-cut a group under
   * somebody else's name and an older date.
   *
   * ONE GRAMMAR, AT BOTH GATES, AND NO SECOND ONE HERE. The candidate document
   * is judged by `checkInquiryBasis` — the catalog's own function, the same one
   * op=promote runs at the write and the checker runs at the gate — over the
   * SAME two registries promote injects, and it is judged BEFORE a byte moves.
   * The refusal is even called `BASIS_REFUSED`, promote's name, because one
   * function answering twice should not answer under two names. So every REC-42
   * refusal fires through this act: an unattributed label, a half-labelled
   * basis, a machine asserter, an undated assertion, a duplicate label and an
   * empty group. What is refused HERE and could not be refused there is the
   * mapping this act introduces and the document does not have — an ordinal
   * naming no leg, and one leg claimed by two groups.
   *
   * THE PARTITION IS ADDRESSED BY ORDINAL and never by target id, which is
   * REC-16's apportionment decision for REC-16's reason: D4 makes duplicate
   * targets legal, a basis legitimately cites one document for two legs, and
   * target-keying would let one instruction move two legs a member meant to
   * separate. `ord` is the leg's position in `basis[]`, which is what
   * `inquiry_basis` already keys on.
   *
   * TWO STATES REFUSE BY NAME, on op=inquirydivide's precedent that a refusal
   * should say which rule it met. `published`: the pair and the per-group
   * breakdown are inside signed, ratified bytes, and re-cutting the partition
   * underneath them would leave the document composing to something an edition
   * on the record contradicts — DEC-12's route is reopen, restructure,
   * republish. `divided`: the parent was declared MALFORMED and carried forward
   * into children, and re-deriving a terminal parent's strength moves a number
   * its children's own disclosure already pointed at.
   *
   * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. No NOTICER. DEC-32 says the system MAY
   * notice a weak leg moved into its own group immediately after a strength
   * drop and surface it; this act makes that possible and does not do it, and
   * the difference matters — noticing is a derived read with a surface half
   * (UI-27's), and building it inside the act would put a judgement about the
   * member's motive in the same function that must never refuse them (*"a
   * machine may not refuse the act and must not hide it"*). What this act does
   * instead is leave the evidence a noticer needs where an append-only history
   * keeps it: the pair AS IT STOOD BEFORE the act and after it, written into
   * the Session Log entry beside the reason, and returned to the caller.
