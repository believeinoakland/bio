 * T18, `inquiry_bundle_facts`, which gained the subject entity in T19; since T33, `inquiry_dated_waits`), with the comments that record why each is shaped as it is. Each carries `bundle_id`

-- leg-earning's (its R12), which creates and declares it; this module's projection writes it only through
-- leg-earning's writeBasis.
-- REC-14 / C-9: what a published case says it does NOT cover. A projection of
-- the completeness_excluded[] block in bundle.md, exactly as inquiry_basis is
-- of basis[] -- the BYTES make the assertion storable and signable, and only
-- this INDEXED projection makes it AUDITABLE. "Which published cases excluded
-- this document" is invariant 7's only mechanical enforcement point at the
-- case level, and without the index on target_id it cannot be asked at all.
--
-- target_id is NULLABLE and every row carries target_id OR prose, NEVER
-- NEITHER (RECONCILED C-9, the capture-or-testify structure REC-24 uses for
-- correspondence). An exclusion may legitimately name something that is not in
-- the record -- "a records request to the City Clerk is still outstanding" is
-- a real exclusion with no id to point at -- so a NOT NULL target would force
-- the member to either invent a referent or say nothing. description and
-- reason are both NOT NULL: WHAT was left out and WHY are two different
-- statements and one does not stand in for the other.
--
-- edition is the edition of the document this projection was taken from, so an
-- auditor reading a row knows which assertion it is. It is NOT in the key: the
-- bytes hold every edition's assertion forever, and this table holds the LIVE
-- document's, re-projected whole on every promotion like every other

-- nothing supersedes the bundle (supersededByOf is its one parser). The column names are the ones they had on bundles,
-- so every reader reads the same name. One row per bundle (retrieval R62: its registered table holds at most one row per
-- key); a bundle with no row reads as NULL for both, as a column never written did. Unindexed beyond the key: both are
-- read by bundle_id. inquiry_subject_entity (N136's rest, T19) is the subject entity R12 records from the document,

-- on bundles.

-- project (promotion R53) enters 'concluded'; a re-conclusion replaces the row. lens_state is 'recorded' (lens_sha the
-- lens's statements_sha), 'none' (no lens was in force for the project: the finding was not made under one), or
-- 'unreadable' (the lens could not be read, or a replay wrote the conclusion): only 'recorded' offers a lens, the rest

-- keeps set_by and set_at while its text and date are unchanged (matched by both, idx its current position); a trigger
-- re-dated or removed by a later revision ENDS the wait it was ('redated' or 'removed', with who and when) and is kept,
