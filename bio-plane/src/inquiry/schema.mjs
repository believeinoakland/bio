-- REC-11 / DATA-MODEL D4: the INQUIRY BASIS -- the legs an inquiry rests on,
-- and invariant 7's storage: a leg whose role is cuts_against is a ROW, so a
-- rendering cannot quietly drop the evidence that argues the other way.
--
-- DERIVED from bundle.md's basis[] frontmatter, written whole at op=promote in
-- the SAME transaction as refs by the same delete-then-insert discipline, so it
-- is a projection of the document and never a second place to state it (D-21).
-- A separate table rather than columns on refs, and that is D4's ruling, not
-- taste: refs' PK has no ordinal, so one document could not be cited for two
-- legs, and a nullable grade on the universal edge projection would create a
-- place to put a grade on edges that must not carry one -- the category error
-- entity_relations refuses structurally above.
--
-- target_id is an INFO- bundle OR another inquiry (INQ-, or a legacy PROB-/
-- FOCUS- id) -- the self-reference IS basis recursion and needs no other
-- mechanism. The basis graph over inquiry-typed legs is a DAG, enforced at the
-- WRITE: op=promote refuses a write whose target would close a cycle, naming
-- the path (before REC-11 the record's only acyclicity protection was a side
-- effect of op=cite refusing non-information members).
--
-- grade is NULLABLE and NULL means undetermined and STATED -- never invented
-- to pass a gate. grade_axis is the axis the grade is ON (capture,
-- connection or testimony -- GRADE_AXES in checks/bio-checks.mjs is the
-- authority, and testimony joined it with MK-2 / IC-142, a leg on a member's
-- authored bundle, graded at TESTIMONY_GRADE and no other letter), recorded
-- on the leg because it is NOT derivable from
-- target_type: a connection grade legitimately sits on an INFO- leg. One
-- column, not two grade columns, because a leg asserts ONE grade for ONE
-- reason (RECONCILED R2). grade_source is resolution (earned, REC-18's path),
-- testimony (a member's signed grade-D account), or hunch (DEC-15): an
-- authored connection grade, the ONLY authored grade permitted above D,
-- requiring an author and a date in the document, visible as a hunch from the
-- moment it is made, and HUNCH DEBT until cleared (BIO_Declared_Bias_v0_1.md).
-- D-188 / DEC-46 (d): HUNCH DEBT, not "bias debt". A hunch is the ONE kind of
-- declared bias that DISQUALIFIES publication (DEC-20); ordinary bias debt is
-- DISCLOSED and travels with the published case. Calling this "bias debt" is
-- what made Bob re-read his own ruling as a contradiction on 2026-08-04.
--
-- inquiry_basis_target is the reverse index: "which inquiries rest on this
-- document" (E2, and REC-17's re-evaluation obligation) is ONE indexed lookup.
-- Cleared in BOTH purge arms via the TABLES list (D-113); hygiene.test.mjs
-- holds that list against this file.
--
-- REC-42 / DEC-32: the ground column IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGS, one
-- nullable column rather than a table because a leg belongs to exactly ONE
-- ground and the leg row is already keyed (bundle_id, ord). Legs sharing a
-- ground are AND-related (the basis is no stronger than the weakest of them);
-- the grounds themselves are OR-related (the basis is as strong as its
-- STRONGEST ground). NULL IS THE IMPLICIT SINGLE GROUND and it is the DEFAULT
-- ON PURPOSE: every leg written before this column existed reads NULL, lands in
-- one ground, and derives exactly the weakest-leg answer it derived before.
-- Bob's ruling (DEC-32): "sometimes the weakest is the claim's strength, and
-- other times it's not. The difference is really whether the relationship
-- between legs is AND or OR."
--
-- THE ATTRIBUTION IS NOT PROJECTED HERE, and that is the deliberate half. A
-- ground's claim to be INDEPENDENTLY SUFFICIENT is asserted per ground, by a
-- named member, in bundle.md's grounds[] block -- one row per label carrying
-- asserted_by and at. It is per (bundle_id, ground), so a column here would
-- state it once per LEG: a second place for one fact to be written, which is
-- what D-21 forbids and what the ordinal above exists to avoid. It is not a
-- second TABLE either, because nothing asks the record a question keyed on it:
-- the assertion is enforced at BOTH gates by one catalog function
-- (checkInquiryBasis, REC-11's precedent) and frozen into the ratified bytes at
-- publication, which is where a reader checks it. If a query ever needs "which
-- grounds did this member assert", THAT is when the table is earned.

-- than typed -- the first version of that probe hand-wrote them, missed bundles_fts_id

-- O(matching legs) and the scan is O(all legs).
-- NO INDEX ON role, and that is the recorded answer rather than an omission: the same
-- probe measured inquiry_basis(role, bundle_id) as a candidate at -9.1% / -10.1%, which
-- is a write cost on every leg of every promote for a read saving inside the noise.
-- role has two values, so the seek reads half the table and the scan reads all of it --
-- an index is worth least exactly where the value is commonest. If a member's question

-- not answer, it times out. The version-leg table gets the same index for the same
