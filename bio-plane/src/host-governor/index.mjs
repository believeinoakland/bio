/* host-governor — the per-host request governor (layer 3; D-95). Requirements: build/requirements/host-governor.md
   (R1–R27). Extracted from `legacy-store` (store.mjs, schema.mjs) and `legacy-index` (index.mjs) in T4 (T4-1, N25).

   Our APPETITE is a configured constant because it is ours. Their CAPACITY is discovered by being refused and
   recorded, the pattern capture_limits proved. The governor lives in the Durable Object because the object
   serialises, so one token bucket is globally correct for the instance for free (R20); a bucket in Worker memory
   governs nothing, since every invocation is independent.

   Pacing resembles a person rather than a loop: grants to one host are separated by a JITTERED gap around the
   appetite's base interval, never a metronome. The chosen constants are recorded in MEASUREMENTS.md as chosen, not
   measured. A 429 overrides the bucket entirely: a cool-off in the future refuses admission regardless of token
   balance, honouring Retry-After when the counterparty names one and escalating with consecutive refusals when it
   does not, mirroring their own escalation. Success decays the escalation to zero. This governs OUR instance only
   and cannot solve the shared-egress problem; that is D-95's recorded limit. Nothing here names a host (R25).

   REACHED THROUGH `governorOf(ctx)` inside the Durable Object (K61), and from a Worker through `governorOverStub`,
   the thin adapter K72 (2) names, which `governedFetch` takes as its `governor`. */
