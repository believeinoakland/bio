/* filings — what the group sends, prepared from the record (requirements: `build/requirements/filings.md`; Design
 * Requirement 8 as amended 2026-09-26, K13, K102; the Action layer, K608; filing templates, K921, K922, K924). For an
 * action whose governing tier is 1 or 2, a draft pre-filled from the record into an offered version of a template
 * (`filing-templates`; the profile's `file` template for the kind by default) or into the member's own words, every
 * filled blank naming its source, the template and version recorded (R1–R5, R28, R29); a member approves it and records
 * that it was sent (R6, R7), and may start a template draft from it (R32). At any tier, a counsel packet (a briefing) for
 * counsel the group names (required at Tier 3) or for the group's own review, marked as prepared for review, never
 * published and never fileable, with a `briefing` section filled from a `brief` template when one is named (R8–R12,
 * R31); its chronology is `events`' timeline, the world's lane and the group's own acts apart (R33; K1494). A
 * communication to anyone is drafted without a template and goes the same way (R23). Approved bytes and
 * exports carry the in-band quartet (R22); whatever is prepared from an action resting on a premise override says so
 * first (R24); exhibits show their grades beside the venue's standard (R25); deadlines state the calendar's
 * confirmation (R30), read by `action-clocks.factReader` (its R12; N474). Candidate theories are proposals, stored
 * apart and labelled (R14). The evidence package's available-actions block is registered with `public-read` (R15)
 * and answered on its own for `escalation` (R21). The AI prepares; a member approves, files and records it. (T48) A Tier 2
 * filing offers a counsel packet beside its advisory (R58); `filingRead` answers a prepared draft as it was stored, so a
 * reload loses nothing (R59); R40's quoting check is `filing-templates`' (R57, its R33). (T50) The matter's stake: the
 * action's own, else its project's, else none (R60), stands in the stamp's `group` beside the team's stake and in the
 * in-band block's words (R61), after an accepted source's identity and stake on its line (R63); `stakeAtPreparation`
 * tells the preparation screen whether to ask (R62: a prompt, never a gate). (T51) It registers once with `case-inputs`
 * (its R19) the source of the minutes beside the group's public comment (R64: `minutesComparisonsOn`), and
 * `templatesForAction` also answers the templates a kind holds that are not offered, with what each lacks, and a court-filed
 * kind (R65). Every sentence it writes is read by key through setup-words (`./words.mjs`; R51, R52; N1116, N1132), the
 * ones written first here by `localize` (setup-words R14), and an undetermined reason another module answers as
 * `{key, vars}` is said in words with `said` (K3997).
 *
 * A NEW MODULE (T8, layer 9): nothing moved into it and it writes no legacy file. Its tables are `./schema.mjs`; a
 * deadline's date is `./dates.mjs`, counted by `action-clocks`' rule. Its R26 library moved to `filing-templates` (T21,
 * K921, K922); its table `filing_templates` stays, written by nothing, as that module's migration's read contract (K986).
 *
 * REACHED as `filingsOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host, created on the first call with `deps`. At creation it
 * creates its tables, declares them to record-core's purge (K23, R19) and registers the available-actions block with
 * `public-read` (its R8; R15 here). `deps` (each module is reached through its factory on the same host unless given):
 *   record, publication, provenance, content   `getSetting`, `allocId`, `transact`, `textAtSha`, `declarePurge`;
 *                                   `publishedEditionsOf`; `captureGrade` (R25); `contentRow`, `captureFor`, `sees`, `passageText` (R8).
 *   attestation    `attestationsOf` (its R7; R9's exhibits and R25's co-attestation), from `attestationOf` (N512: split
 *                  from `provenance`, whose R49 it was).
 *   publicRead     `registerEvidenceBlock` (its R8; R15), from `publicReadOf` (K651).
 *   strength       `projectBar` (its R14): the floors of R22's quartet.
 *   membership     `inSight` (its R80): the sight of the project a draft, packet or template draws on (R11, R13, K316).
 *   actions        `actionRead` (its R29), `actionCorrespond` (R15, R16), from `actionsOf` (K253); and its module-level
 *                  `noSuchAction` (R43), through which every missing action is answered (N217).
 *   actionClocks   `clockPropose` (its R2, was actions R32; K617), from `actionClocksOf`.
 *   filingTemplates  `offeredVersion` (its R25; R28, R31), `templatesFor`, `templateRead` (its R14; R28, R29),
 *                  `templateDraft` (its R3; R32), from `filingTemplatesOf` (K921, K922).
 *   localFacts     `factStatus` (its R2; R30): each holiday year a packet's business-day deadline reads, as action-clocks
 *                  R10 reads it, from `localFactsOf`.
 *   conformance    `determinationRead` (its R9), `determinationsFor` (R11), from `conformanceOf` (K252).
 *   standards      `standardRead` (its R5), `inForce` (R7), from `standardsOf(host, deps)` (K251); (T35) its `access`,
 *                  `designation`, `edition` (R39, R41) and `editionInForce` (R40), R8's carriage of a standard not free.
 *   consequences   `consequencesOf` (its R7), from `consequencesModule(host, deps)` (K171 (17), K250).
 *   promotion      `fact("producingGroup")` (its R40; R3's `group`, N331), from `promotionOf` on the same host unless given.
 *   caseInputs     `registerMinutesComparisons` (its R19; R64), from `caseInputsOf` when this module is handed one or the
 *                  composition root's environment (`env`), as `action-replies` registers its open requests (R3).
 *   events         `timeline` (its R28–R30; R33's chronology) and `readEvent` (its R26; the captures R9's exhibits take from
 *                  the events the chronology lists), from `eventsOf` (T33-75, K1494).
 *   producingGroup a function answering the instance's producing group, or null when none is recorded (R3's `group`),
 *                  or answering promotion's fact as `fact` answers it. No caller hands one in since the legacy store's
 *                  retirement (a test may); absent, the group is read through `promotion.fact("producingGroup")`.
 *   profiles       a function answering the active profiles (ids or profile objects) to combine; default record-core's
 *                  setting `jurisdiction_profiles` (its R26).
 *   now            the clock for the instants it writes, an ISO string (default: the wall clock, to the second).
 *
 * READ CONTRACTS it joins in its own SQL: publication's `cases` and `published_cases` (`case_id`, `edition`,
 * `project_id`, `ratified_at`, its R40); provenance's `register` and `captured_locators` (its R48).
 *
 * No place, law, venue, template or legal organisation is named here (R20): every one comes from the active
 * jurisdiction profiles' combined view (`jurisdictions.combine` over record-core's `jurisdiction_profiles`), or from
 * the group's own templates (`filing-templates`). */
