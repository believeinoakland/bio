/* extraction (layer 4): readings made from captured bytes, and what the record keeps of them. The store half
   (R19–R30, R36–R40, R61–R62) and the Durable Object's wiring of the reading (R1, R18 through `read`, handing
   `reading-pipeline` the store and the view; R31–R35 through `pdfStructure`), reached through `extractionOf(ctx)`
   (K61). Moved from `store.mjs` (the reading writer, the re-read, the history, the text-source and text-index writers,
   the reads, the term helpers, the drift reads) and `index.mjs` (`op=pdfstructure`, the acquire wire's reading block),
   with the rows this job applied named at their sites. The tier ladder and the reading's provenance moved on to
   `reading-pipeline` (N513, T25). The tables are this module's own (`schema.mjs`), declared to record-core's purge here (R49). T19 layer 4:
   the testimony path's index as a projection in `provenance`'s slot (R65), the figures through record-core's
   `registerCounts` and `textIndexOk` (R67), and N26's migration of stored `.docx` readings (R66). T20 layer 4: N439's
   migration of stored `.pptx` readings (R68), run by the same machine as N26's. T33 layer 4: every reading's commit
   calls its storage's `reading-pipeline.readHooksOf(ctx).afterRead` once (R69, T33-23a). T42 layer 4: `op=pagetranscribe`,
   the AI's reading of the pages Civicsmith could not read (R71), through the one transcriber the composition root
   registers (R72), so nothing above this layer is imported; R58's contract names `capture_text`. */
