/* queue-producers — the feed's producers (requirements: `build/requirements/queue-producers.md`, R1–R51).
 * Split out of `queue` by N363 (Bob's K507; seams ruled K531, `build/plan/draft-N363-queue-split.md` §1, §3.2): each
 * producer derives, on read and writing nothing, the items one provider's facts earn for a viewer, naming each item's
 * subjects and home subjects, for `queue` to home, offer, mint and publish.
 *
 *   feedItems      queue's one read of this module (R8): every item R1, R2, R4–R7, R9, R14, R23, R30–R35, R37–R39, R41, R42 derive
 *                  for a member and viewer, each producer read as a feed of its own (R45: one that cannot be read is named in
 *                  `facts.failed`, one with no provider composed in `facts.absent`, and the others' items stand), every sentence
 *                  of an item read by key through `./words.mjs` (R43: `summary_key`, `detail_key`), every item `machinery-producers.conditionItems` answers (its R1: the
 *                  CONDITIONs about our own machinery, split out by K1850) and every item `action-producers.actionItems`
 *                  answers (its R13: the Action layer's to-dos, was this module's R15–R21, R29, moved by T45, K2781 (1)),
 *                  each homed through queue's walk and carrying queue's options (both passed in),
 *                  with the facts the answer publishes beside them. No item carries `disposition` (queue's mint gives
 *                  it) or `catalogue_id` (queue stamps it from its R2).
 *   proposalFindingItems, CARDINALITY_EXCEEDED   the FINDING producer over `progressions.proposalsFeed` (R2, R10, R11),
 *                  pure, re-exported from `./proposals.mjs`.
 *
 *   registerPlaceArrivals   R38's one door: `instance-setup` registers its `placeArrivals` read here once at start (K31's
 *                  pattern), since it comes later in layer 11.
 *
 *   R46–R48     the `members` feed (T51's fix round, K4169, UC-046): an endorsement owed on a proposed administrator, an owner vote
 *                  owed on a project's owner change, an expertise awaiting confirmation, each carrying its door (`door`, K4210).
 *   R49–R51     one read asks for each kind of fact once (no read per item or per project), a failed feed names its read and
 *                  code, and `facts.ms` says what each feed cost.
 *
 * REACHED as `queueProducersOf(ctx, deps)`: one instance per Durable Object storage. It registers nothing with an earlier
 * module and holds no check row: it refuses nothing a member does (draft §3.3); a second registration at R38's door is a
 * programming error answered to its caller.
 * `deps` (each defaults to its module's instance on the same `ctx`, reached lazily when first asked):
 *   record, membership, credentials, provenance, captureRequests, basisVersions, progressions, aiRuns, bias, publication,
 *   corpusExport, reevaluation, intent, monitoring, contradiction, docket, caseImport, wizardScripts, caseTensions,
 *   publishSchedule, projectRoster   the providers; and `machinery` (machinery-producers, K1850) and `actionProducers` (action-producers,
 *   T45), each built lazily over these same deps, so a dep a caller injects reaches them too (the moved producers' own:
 *   governor, capture, captureRequests, monitoring, linkSweep, networkNotices, actions; and actionClocks, escalation,
 *   actionPlans, actions, actionHolds, filingTemplates, localFacts, following, planWork).
 *
 * R7 (queue's homes walk) and R12 (queue's options) stay in queue, one walk and one derivation: `feedItems` takes them
 * as `homesOf(subjectIds)` and `optionsOf(subjectIds)`, closed over the read's viewer and identity by queue, and holds
 * them for the length of that one synchronous read. `#homesAt` (a case at depth 0) is built over `homesOf`, and both are
 * handed on to `machinery-producers.conditionItems` and `action-producers.actionItems` as they were handed here.

   *  IN A CASE, MEASURED, and the reason it is measured rather than asserted.
   *
   *  The out-of-inquiry lead's defining property is an ABSENCE: the document is
   *  in the store and is deliberately part of NO claim. `CLAUDE.md` is explicit
   *  that an absence at one level is not evidence of absence at the next, and
   *  that saying WHICH is true is a first-class obligation rather than a
   *  diagnostic detail. A `basis` field simply omitting the leg would say
   *  nothing at all — a reader could not tell "we looked and it is in no case"
   *  from "nobody has read this document yet" from "this producer does not
   *  report that". So this asks BOTH basis projections directly and reports the
   *  counts it got, so the absence in the answer is the record's own and is
   *  dated by the read that made it.
   *
   *  BOTH PROJECTIONS, because there are two and they are different questions.
   *  `inquiry_basis` is the CURRENT basis of an inquiry (D-21's projection of
   *  `basis[]`), and `inquiry_basis_version_legs` holds the legs of every
   *  alternative composition anybody has proposed (PL-1's versions). A document
   *  absent from the first and present in the second IS part of a case — a
   *  suggested one — and reporting only the first would let the item announce
   *  "not part of any claim" about a document a run has already built a reading
   *  on. Neither table is filtered by inquiry: the claim being made is about the
   *  whole record, and narrowing it to inquiry B would make the sentence
   *  narrower than it reads.
   *
   *  A CAPTURE WITH NO REGISTER ROW IS `undetermined`, NOT `absent`. The
   *  register is what says which bundle a capture's bytes were registered
   *  under, so with no row there is no bundle to ask about and the honest answer
   *  is that this producer could not determine it — which is a different fact

  /** `out-of-inquiry-lead` (D-213, ANSWERED 2026-08-06 by Bob under DEC-60) —
   *  THE FINDING-CLASS SLUG WITH A PRODUCER, and this is the producer.
   *
   *  THE HOLE IT FILLS. DEC-60's investigative session reads ALL of a project's
   *  inquiries for context and writes only to the SUBJECT one, so evidence it
   *  turns up bearing on a DIFFERENT question — the same vendor holding three
   *  other contracts, met while investigating whether one was competitively bid
   *  — had nowhere to go and was dropped BY CONSTRUCTION. That is D-194's
   *  authored frontier with a PRODUCER generating them continuously rather than
   *  a member noticing one occasionally, which is what makes it worth a kind.
   *
   *  THE FACT IS THE REQUEST ROW'S OWN. `lead_inquiry` is written at the door by
   *  the run that made the observation, and this walk reads it. Nothing here
   *  infers a lead from subject matter, from a shared entity or from a
   *  similarity: an observation a producer can manufacture is one a producer can
   *  invent, and a notification claiming a member's attention on a manufactured
   *  connection is the record claiming more than it can support.
   *
   *  THE `case` SET DERIVES FROM INQUIRY B'S ANCESTORS, NOT A'S, and that IS the
   *  item. Filing a lead under the question the run happened to be working is
   *  what made these homeless in the first place — the evidence is about B, the
   *  people who need it are the people working B, and REC-20's every-ancestor
   *  walk over B is what routes it to them. `#conditionsCaptureRequested` walks
   *  the SAME table and files on `target`, which is correct for what IT
   *  announces (a capture this run asked for has completed) and wrong for this.
   *  Two producers, one table, two different homes, and the difference is the
   *  whole reason both exist.
   *
   *  FINDING AND NOT CONDITION. A CONDITION is a fact about our own machinery
   *  and a member may MUTE it personally (D-125, DEC-16). A lead is a fact about
   *  the world, and muting is exactly what must not be available: one member's
   *  inbox hygiene would remove a real lead from their view while the record
   *  went on believing the team had been told. It leaves the list the way every
   *  finding does — adopted, deferred or dismissed as an authored, attributed
   *  act. queuestate.mjs classes the slug FINDING and the mint refuses anything
   *  else, so this is enforced rather than intended.
   *
   *  GATED ON `lead_inquiry` AND NOT ON `target`. The item is ABOUT question B,
   *  it is FILED under B, and its acts are offered on B — so B is what a viewer
   *  must be able to see for the item to exist for them at all. A member invited
   *  to B and not to A learns nothing about A here beyond the fact that some run
   *  captured this document, which is the same disclosure `basis.source` makes
   *  everywhere else. Withheld WHOLE and with no count, the posture REC-30 set.
   *
   *  ONLY `captured` ROWS. A lead whose capture has not landed is not yet a
   *  lead a member can act on: the point of D-213's answer is that the DOCUMENT
   *  IS IN THE STORE, and announcing one before the bytes arrive would offer a
   *  member acts over something that may still be refused at the drain. */

  /* ======================================================================
   * PL-13 / IS-3 — THE TWO SHARED-INQUIRY SLUGS, AND WHY THE MODEL NEEDS THEM.
   *
   * D-216's MODEL CHECK IS THE PRECONDITION AND ITS ANSWER IS **PER-PROJECT**
   * (landed 2026-08-08, DRIVEN through twelve ops against the real control
   * plane rather than read). §7 is correct and cloning the inquiry on
   * divergence is NOT the honest answer, because a clone duplicates the whole
   * evidence trail and the copies drift, so the shared investigation stops
   * being shared. The sharing edge is a `cites` row in `refs`; the inquiry's
   * own bytes carry NO stance; a read naming no project gets no `current` field
   * at all, which is a refusal to guess rather than a default.
   *
   * THAT ANSWER IS WHAT MAKES THESE TWO KINDS NECESSARY, and stating it the
   * other way round is the whole design. Because the stance is per-project,
   * NOTHING REFUSES A DIVERGENCE — two projects standing on two readings of one
   * question is a legal state that was measured happening with no refusal from
   * the plane. A legal state nobody is told about is a silent one, and the
   * failure mode is concrete: a team builds a case on a reading its partners
   * abandoned, and finds out at publication. So the cost of the correct model
   * is paid HERE, in the feed, by telling people — never by a reconciliation
   * that would quietly re-impose the single shared stance §7 rejected.
   *
   * BOTH ARE DERIVED ON READ AND NEITHER ADDS A TABLE. That is a finding rather
   * than a shortcut and it is worth naming, because a stance-divergence LEDGER
   * is the obvious build and it would be wrong twice over: it would be a second
   * place a stance is stated (D-21), and it would be a derived table that
   * `op=purge` must be taught about or silently leave rows behind (D-113). The
   * facts these two walk are ALREADY the record's own — `refs`, the projects'
   * own frontmatter, `inquiry_basis_versions` — so there is nothing to store,
   * nothing to go stale, and nothing for a purge to miss.
   *
   * WHAT THEY DO NOT DO. Neither refuses anything, neither moves a pointer, and
   * neither writes. `op=versioncurrent` moves ONE project's stance and moves
   * nothing else — PL-2 built it, D-216 measured it, and the plan row's
   * accepts-when says so in terms. These producers report; they do not
   * reconcile. A notification that changed somebody else's stance would be the
   * single shared stance arriving through the back door.
   * ====================================================================== */


  /** THE SHARED QUESTIONS, and the walk is bounded by the edge table rather
   *  than by the corpus. An inquiry is SHARED when two or more distinct bundles
   *  cite it; the `refs_target` index answers that with one grouped read, and
   *  the expensive per-project frontmatter confirmation then runs only over
   *  questions that could possibly diverge. A question ONE project draws on can
   *  hold no divergence and is never opened.
   *
   *  D-480 — THE GROUP RUNS OVER WHAT THE CALLER CAN SEE, AND THE PARAGRAPH
   *  THAT USED TO STAND HERE WAS WRONG IN A WAY WORTH KEEPING ON THE RECORD.
   *  It said the `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT bundle_id) > 1` was on the UNGATED
   *  table ON PURPOSE — a CANDIDATE filter, not the answer, since
   *  `#projectsDrawingOn` gates afterwards and can take the real count back
   *  below two. **That is true of every candidate the page REACHES and says
   *  nothing about the page's EDGE**, which is the whole defect (found by
   *  D-464's worker, `BIO_Membership_Architecture_v2.md` §7 item 7.9). The
   *  candidate read is BOUNDED at `QUEUE_SHARED_INQUIRIES_MAX` and ordered by
   *  `target_id`, so a hidden project's citations do two things a later gate
   *  cannot undo: they make a question that only ONE visible project draws on
   *  qualify as shared, and that question then TAKES A SLOT — displacing a
   *  visible one past the cap and flipping the `inquiries_truncated` the feed
   *  publishes on every item. A count-shaped side channel, D-447's and D-464's
   *  class: *"Not its existence"* arriving as an aggregate.
   *
   *  THE FIX IS D-464'S AND D-486'S SUBTRACTION, NOT A SECOND SIGHT RULE, and
   *  that is also the answer to the old paragraph's performance objection.
   *  membership's `hiddenBundles(viewer)` (its R88; N352) is the ONE set of bundles the caller's own
   *  `viewerPredicate` does not pass, spelled once and read here as a set —
   *  `NOT IN`, an indexed subtraction SQLite materialises once per statement,
   *  never the per-row correlated gate the old paragraph rightly refused. Who
   *  is filtered is the gate's word, inherited rather than restated: a
   *  credential the gate does not filter (scope `member`) gets `hid` = nothing
   *  and the read it always got; an administrator, the founder included, gets
   *  the hidden projects it neither was invited to nor joined (D54), and a
   *  viewer SENT but unrecognised is DENY, so every bundle is hidden and the
   *  candidate set is empty — fails closed.
   *
   *  BOTH ENDS OF THE EDGE, and the second is not scope creep but the same
   *  sentence: a question the caller cannot see is dropped by
   *  `#queueSharedInquiry` a few lines below, so it never mints an item — but
   *  until this landing it still consumed a slot on the way there. The
   *  subtraction is over `bundles`, so a `target_id` naming NOTHING (a
   *  `references[]` entry for a document nobody has captured — the common case)
   *  is in no hidden set and is kept exactly as before, then dropped by the
   *  same existence check that always dropped it. Nothing here tightens what is
   *  ANSWERED; it decides only which rows are allowed to fill the bounded page.
   *
   *  THE CANDIDATE FILTER IS STILL A CANDIDATE FILTER. The severed-status
   *  confirmation and the per-project frontmatter read still run afterwards in
   *  `#projectsDrawingOn` and can still take the real count back below two, in
   *  which case no item is minted. */

  /** `new-version-arrived-from-another-team` (PL-13 / IS-3) — A READING OF A
   *  SHARED QUESTION, PROPOSED UNDER SOMEBODY ELSE'S WORK.
   *
   *  THE TEAM IS READ, NOT INFERRED, AND WHERE IT CANNOT BE READ NO ITEM IS
   *  MINTED. A version row carries `author` (a member) and `run`. A MEMBER does
   *  not name a team: this record has no member-to-project map and inventing
   *  one from who-has-edited-what is exactly the manufactured connection
   *  `#findingsOutOfInquiryLead` refuses to make. What IS a stored fact is the
   *  RUN's context: `ai_runs.context_type='project'` with a `context_id`, set
   *  when the run was opened. So the source team is the run's context project
   *  or it is nothing, and a version composed by hand — or by a run whose
   *  context is the instance rather than a project — mints NO item at all.
   *
   *  THAT SILENCE IS A REAL COST AND IT IS DECLARED RATHER THAN ABSORBED. A
   *  hand-composed version of a shared question genuinely does reach the other
   *  team unannounced, and this producer cannot fix that without claiming to
   *  know something the record does not hold. Announcing it anyway — "arrived
   *  from another team" about a version whose team is undetermined — is the
   *  record claiming more than it can support, which this project ranks as
   *  worse than a missing feature. The gap is stated here, asserted in
   *  `shared.test.mjs` (R2: a run-less version produces NO item, driven), and
   *  raised as **D-266** so it is a known hole with a name rather than a
   *  surprise for whoever next reads this feed.
   *
   *  THE SOURCE PROJECT IS REMOVED FROM ITS OWN ITEM'S HOMES, and this is the
   *  one place this file filters a walk's result. `homesOf([inquiry])`
   *  returns EVERY project citing the question, including the one the version
   *  came from — and telling a team that a reading "arrived from another team"
   *  when they authored it is a false sentence, not merely noise. So the source
   *  is dropped from `case.ancestors` and the drop is DECLARED on the item
   *  (`case.excluded`) rather than performed quietly: a home set that is
   *  silently shorter is the exact failure DEC-16's truncation rule exists to
   *  prevent, and a filtered set that says so is not one.
   *
   *  HIDDEN VERSIONS ARE INCLUDED AND FLAGGED, NEVER FILTERED (D-214,
   *  DEC-29(b)). Hiding is a display decision one project made; it is not a
   *  reason another project should never learn the reading was proposed. */

     * The gap D-266 folds in is this producer's, and it is real — a reading of
     * a shared question composed BY HAND, or by a run whose context is not one
     * of the projects named here, reaches the other team with NO item minted,
     * because the source team is the RUN's stored context or it is nothing and
     * this producer will not guess one. **That much does not change here and
     * must not: attributing a team we cannot read is the record claiming more
     * than it can support, which this project ranks as worse than the silence.**
     *
     * WHAT DOES CHANGE IS THAT THE SILENCE IS NO LONGER SILENT. Absence at one
     * level is not evidence of absence at the next, and saying WHICH is true is
     * a first-class obligation rather than a diagnostic detail (CLAUDE.md). A
     * member reading this feed could not tell *no reading arrived from another
     * team* from *readings arrived and this record cannot say whose they are* —
     * two very different facts that rendered identically as an empty list. The
     * count below is the second one, published on the feed's envelope, and it
     * is deliberately a COUNT AND AN INQUIRY rather than a version name and a
     * guess: it says how much this read could not attribute and where to go and
     * look, and it claims nothing whatever about who authored anything.
     *

  /** `export-performed` (D-52, catalogue id N-1) — Membership v2 §8.1: *"The export is recorded in
   *  the append-only history, so it can never happen silently, and every administrator is notified."*
   *  The RECORD half was `export_log` and `op=exportlog`, which reach an administrator who LOOKS; this
   *  is the notification half, which reaches one who does not.
   *
   *  ONE ITEM PER `export_log` ROW, IN EVERY ADMINISTRATOR'S FEED AND IN NO OTHER. The reader is an
   *  administrator when `#isAdminMember` says so of the stamped member (the founder's own session is
   *  ROOT_ADMIN and counts), or, for a machine credential, when the credential IS the ADMIN_TOKEN class
   *  — the root of trust that took the export. Every other reader gets nothing, and not a count: an
   *  ordinary member is not told an export exists, since §8.1's audience is the administrators. The
   *  rule is asked of the READER, never of the exporter, so the item cannot collapse to "the person
   *  who exported was told" — the failure this item's control arm is aimed at.
   *
   *  DERIVED ON READ from the log itself, the lead's and the conclusions' precedent: no table, no purge
   *  arm (D-113), and it cannot disagree with `op=exportlog` about what was exported. An administrator
   *  appointed after an export is told of it too, which is the reading of "every administrator" that
   *  leaves no administrator uninformed.
   *
   *  WHAT IT CANNOT YET DO, STATED ON THE ITEM: leave anyone's list. It is a FINDING, and a finding
   *  leaves by an authored disposition or a member's personal mute; the disposition is scoped to a
   *  project and an export has none, and the personal mute of a finding (D-125) is ruled and not built.
   *  So the notice is bounded to the log's newest `EXPORT_LOG_LIMIT_DEFAULT` rows instead, and the bound
   *  is published. */
