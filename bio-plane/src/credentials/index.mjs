/* credentials — the credentials a person or the instance acts by: the founder's password and claim, members' passwords
 * and sessions, the signer keys whose signatures the record accepts, the credentials AI work runs under, the short-lived
 * grant an ask or a standing question reads under, the group's own keys for keyed outside services (T33-20); and, from
 * T35 (the security package N680, N703, K1888; K1881, K1934), the sign-in window, sign-out, sessions held as digests,
 * agent credential expiry, the count-only security tally with its map and level, and administrators' recovery codes;
 * and, from T36 (T36-7; DEC-172, K1946, K2038), each outside security tool's credentials under R29, the tally's totals
 * for a period and its store-internal route; and, from T37 (T37-6; DEC-182 (4), N761), a member's own password change
 * and a mint that carries no digest refused; and, from T47 (T47-9, T47-81; N955, K2976, K3060 D4, K3061 D3, K3076), a
 * run segment's credential minted in the plane, sessions by device and inactivity with their lock, the password asked
 * again, sign-in by handle, every member's recovery codes and the administrator's reset link; and, from T50 (T50-5;
 * N1186, K3557), the optional project a grant or a run's credential is minted in, which fences the viewer it makes
 * (R79: membership R149's `projectViewer`).
 *
 * Which AI account pays for an assistant's act (each member's own reference and sign-in, the group's API key, a
 * project's account, the switches for each kind of use, the material limits, the notices and the disclosure, each
 * account's history) moved to `ai-accounts` in T48 (T48-10, T48-11; N996, K3101), split by copy (K617, K624). This
 * module creates it in its factory with the seal secret and asks it, never a copy (R27, R29, R32, R63, R73), and answers
 * its services, `USE_KINDS`, `ACCOUNT_CHECKS` and its ops through thin delegates until their users re-point (R72).
 *
 * Requirements: build/requirements/credentials.md (R1–R79; R26, and R22–R25, R33–R37, R43, R51, R52, R54–R62, R64, R70
 * moved to `ai-accounts`, retired). Split from `membership` (K617, K636 BOB-1, K637; T19 layer
 * 2, CREDENTIALS #1): the code is copied from `membership/index.mjs` and `schema.mjs`, without change of meaning, and
 * reads `members` only through membership's services (`memberFacts`, `sessionRights`, `isAdministrator`,
 * `activeAdmins`, `notAnAdmin`), never by SQL. Who the members are, and what each may do, is membership's; this module
 * never decides it. Membership reaches this module's sessions and keys only through its `onRevoked` notice (R16), and
 * reads the founder's claim through the one fact this module registers (R17).
 *
 * SHAPE (K61). `credentialsOf(ctx)` answers the one instance for a Durable Object's storage, over `ctx.storage.sql`,
 * reaching record-core by `recordOf(ctx)` and membership by `membershipOf(ctx)` on the same `ctx`; a test may pass its
 * own as `credentialsOf(ctx, { record, membership })`, and the composition root passes the Worker's seal secret
 * (`sealSecret`, R29; handed to `ai-accounts`, its R24, R32) on the first call. Its first construction is this
 * module's start: it registers the revocation listener (R16) and the claim fact (R17) with membership, and the
 * clearing listener (R73) with `ai-accounts`. Every refusal names its reason; no service
 * throws.

   * membership's R81 (a second registration is refused, so `start` is idempotent through `credentialsOf`).
   * R20 (K774): `setPassword` registered as the setter membership's `enroll` calls inside its own act (its R95), so a
   * member's password is set in the one act that enrols them, as before the split, and membership stores none. The
   * setter is asked `{role, password}` and answers R3's `{ok, role}` (a promise: the derivation is asynchronous). Until
   * membership offers R95 (its later work in this layer, K774) there is nothing to register with, and `password` reads
   * null.
