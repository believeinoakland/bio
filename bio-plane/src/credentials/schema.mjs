-- PL-11 / IS-5 / D-199: THE ai CREDENTIAL'S DECLARED TASK SCOPE, AND THE
-- WHOLE REASON IT IS A TABLE RATHER THAN A BINDING.
--
-- The four token classes -- admin, member, probe, daemon -- are ENV BINDINGS:
-- an operator sets a value in the hosting dashboard and the plane compares
-- against it, a settings row by another name, which D-199 (2) rules out for
-- this one class (DEC-17's reasoning: a settings row "would be a way to change
-- the standard with nothing to read afterwards"). A presented ai token resolves
-- HERE, against a row a member wrote: who minted it, when, for whom, and what
-- it may do. Amending the reach is another row with a name against it.
--
-- THE VALUE IS NEVER STORED. 'token_id' is the IDENTITY, a short public name
-- the record can print, an act can cite and a member can revoke; 'secret_sha'
-- is the SHA-256 of the presented value, which a lookup compares.
--
-- BOTH PRINCIPAL KINDS ARE LEGITIMATE AND CARRY DIFFERENT ACCOUNTABILITY, which
-- is why 'principal_kind' is not nullable (D-199 (4), DEC-55 det 4): an
-- ORGANISATION-scoped key acts for the group, a MEMBER-scoped key is
-- attributable to that member. 'principal' IS THE VIEWER the plane stamps on
-- this credential's reads, so who is behind it and what it may read are one
-- string.
--
-- 'scope_writes' is a JSON array of op names, arriving already judged at the
-- mint edge (the control plane's ops table is the only thing that knows which
-- ops a member reaches); the declared writes narrow that floor, never widen it.
--
-- NOT PURGED (R18): this is identity, and a whole-store purge that cleared it
-- would revoke every agent's authority as a side effect of resetting the corpus.
