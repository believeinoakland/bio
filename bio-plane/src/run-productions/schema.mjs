-- never how a run must RESPOND, so a retry loop that resends the identical
-- submission would otherwise be caught only by the budget -- and the budget is
-- the backstop, not the mechanism. This table makes the second submission
-- change nothing at all: no re-evaluation, no write, no tick.

-- THE KEY IS THE SUBMISSION ITSELF, BYTE FOR BYTE, AND NOT A HASH. That is
-- PL-1's own reasoning transplanted: a hand-rolled synchronous hash would put a
-- collision argument underneath a mechanism that decides whether a caller is
-- told the truth about its own submission, and the composition is bounded
-- already because the endpoint caps a version's legs.
--
-- base_sha IS PART OF THE IDENTITY, and it is what stops the key going stale
-- into a false refusal. "Verbatim resubmit" means NOTHING HAS CHANGED --
-- neither the submission nor the document it would be written into. The moment
-- the inquiry moves, the same submission is a different question and is
-- evaluated again.
--
-- SCRATCH-CLASS, in capture_sessions' and ai_runs' family and NOT record: it
-- holds no member act, nothing derived from one, and nothing a case is built

-- SK-8 / EXTRACTION-BREADTH-DESIGN.md section 4's THIRD production row, placed by
-- BIO_Assistant_and_AI_Roles_v0_1.md section 7.3: A PROPOSED READING -- entities
-- and facts the registered readers did not find, proposed by an EXTRACT run
-- inside DEC-62's run object, carrying the ai(function, version) step this
-- record designed at CPDF-10 and nothing emitted until now.
--
-- WHY IT IS NOT readings / reading_refs, AND THE REASON IS STRUCTURAL RATHER
-- THAN TIDINESS. Section 7.3 (6): an uncited machine-minted row is a PROPOSAL,
-- "never counted as extraction coverage". Those three tables ARE the extraction
-- coverage -- op=readingref, op=readingname, the recogniser and every earned
-- connection tier read them -- so a machine's proposal written there would count
-- as coverage BY CONSTRUCTION, and no label on top could undo a count that was
-- already wrong. The separation is the mechanism, not a convention somebody has
-- to remember. The corollary is the same reasoning inverted and it is in
-- extractrun.mjs's header: the ai step is NOT on a minted content row's chain,
-- because the content id is hash(capture, extent, chain) and changing it is
-- exactly how a member's later citation would stop FINDING the machine's row.
--
-- chain IS THE PROPOSAL'S OWN CHAIN: the capture's chain with one ai step
-- appended through textchain's appendStep, so rule 2 (every derivation weakens)
-- is enforced by the module that owns it and TEXT_CHAIN_STRENGTHENS is the
-- refusal a caller earns. cap is the chain's computed derivation cap and NULL
-- means UNDETERMINED and STATED -- no calibration of any propose-reading
-- function exists, so the honest step carries no letter.
--
-- earned is B or C and is COMPUTED from what the reference NAMES, never
-- offered by the caller (DEC-24 rule 3 -- a caller that offers one is refused by
-- name at the door). There is no route to A: A is what a reference the SOURCE
-- assigned is worth, and a machine that read a string out of prose did not get
-- one.
--
-- The three position columns are reading_refs' own, in IC-1's vocabulary and no
-- other, moving together exactly as they do there: a row has all three or none,
-- and NULL means THIS PROPOSAL CANNOT SAY WHERE rather than that the whole
-- document was meant.
--
-- content_id is the passage this proposal made citable, present exactly when
-- the run minted one through SK-7's door (op=contentmint's store half) -- which
-- needs a readable position, since a passage with no extent is the whole
-- document and minting that per reference would manufacture nothing useful.
-- NULL is the ordinary case and is not a failure.
--
-- DERIVED-BUT-AUTHORED, and purge treats it as instance-scoped state: a
-- per-bundle purge clears this document's proposals and a whole-store purge
-- clears them all (D-113), because a proposal that outlived the document it
-- points at would resolve to nothing.
