/* run-productions — what an AI run produces, and the only way it produces it (requirements:
 * `build/requirements/run-productions.md`, R1–R25; map: `build/extraction/run-productions.md`). Extracted from the
 * legacy store (PL-3/IS-4's suggest endpoint `suggestVersion` with `#suggestionPersisted` and `#suggestionFrontmatter`;
 * SK-8's `extractPropose` and `extractProposals` with `#posFields`; the dispatch of `op=suggest`, `op=extractpropose`
 * and `op=extractproposals`), from the legacy schema (`suggest_refusals`, `proposed_readings`) and from the check
 * catalogue (C-27 and C-104, now this module's own rows in `checks.mjs`).
 *
 * `runProductionsOf(ctx, deps)` answers the one instance per Durable Object storage (K61). It reaches `record-core`,
 * `membership`, `content`, `connections`, `ai-runs`, `strength`, `citation`, `inquiry` and `basis-versions` through their
 * factories; a run is read only through ai-runs' `runFor` (its R28) and a bound through its `boundOf` and
 * `consumeBound` (its R29), never in this module's SQL (N194); whether the caller holds the run is `run-rules`'
 * `runPrincipalGate` (its R5). It declares its tables to purge (R17, K23), registers
 * its candidate source with basis-versions (R14; its R40), and registers its machine-passage read with inquiry (its
 * R62) and basis-versions (its R49) (R25).
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO (§4, §10): it accepts, hides, rejects or makes current nothing; it captures and requests
 * nothing; it notifies nobody; it opens no run, writes no run and no bound row (R18), and it reads a run only through
 * `ai-runs.runFor` and spends a bound only through `ai-runs.consumeBound`. */
