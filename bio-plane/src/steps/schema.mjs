/* steps: the tables this module owns (R22). A step's row holds its place, work, doer, state and date; every act on it
   is a row of its own, appended, so nothing it did is overwritten (R5, R10, R13). Purge follows the step's place:
   `steps` is keyed by `project_id` (a project-placed step goes with its project), `step_refs` by `question_id` (a
   question's reference goes with the question), and the triggers below take a question-placed step with its last
   reference, and every row a step holds with the step, so no row outlives the step it belongs to. The follows are
   their member's own (`sight: "owner"`), keyed by the question. No table names a place. */
