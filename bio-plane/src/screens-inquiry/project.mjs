 *
 * Self-contained functions (interface-shell R21 (1)); the readers they share are the screen's `parts` (common.mjs). The
 * subject read is `projectstage` (R21): it answers a project she cannot see as absent, and one she sees only to exist as
 * `PROJECT_SEEN_NOT_A_PARTICIPANT` with its name and owners, so the not-joined state (R1) and an administrator's rescue
 * (R30, state c) are drawn, never "Nothing is here".
 *
 * The project's questions (R9): `projectquestions`, paged to the end by its `cursor`, each with its `inquirystrength`; a
 * project with none (state b) asks "Your first question" (R43). Its own bar (R10) by `strengthbarof`, set by
 * `projectbarset`. "Open a question" writes the inquiry and draws it into the project (R11); "Draw on a question from
 * elsewhere" chooses among the questions she may see (R16). "This project's work" (R27): its plans (`plans`), and the
 * calculations, standards and timeline its own references name. Who can find it (R28, `projectvisibility`); its members
 * and owners (R29, `projectparticipants`, `projectownervotes`), the founder unnamed by key (R40). Every sentence a key.
 *
 * Fix round 3 (T51): "The project's documents" (R128; DEC-394 (3a)), every document filed under the project, read by `heldcaptures` and listed again by
 * its act; a project with no history of who can find it that was opened within the minute says it was started (C79; R28); a member the reads name is
 * drawn by her handle, never by her id (C94; R29, R40, R54). */
