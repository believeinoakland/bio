/* screens-inquiry R3: the document screen (Projects › <project> › Document; registry screen `document`, its 11 acts).
 *
 * Self-contained functions (interface-shell R21 (1)). The document is the INFO bundle `view.subject` its capture is
 * filed in; its capture's digest is its provenance document's `documents[0].capture.sha256` (never `content_hash`, the
 * dataset digest, capture grammar C-2.7; K3387), its address `source.locator`. What needs the digest
 * or the address (the reading and its passages, the grade note, the versions) is read once the document is read.
 * `release` and `retire` act on a selection (`ratification` takes a handle), so each makes its own selection of this
 * document (`op=select`) and sends itself, drawing its own outcome beside the act. Opening the original goes through
 * `open-file` (`screens-intake`) by the capture's SHA-256, never by the bundle id (R22). `pagetranscribe` is drawn only while the assistant is reachable (interface-shell R20;
 * DEC-190). "Watch for changes" (`monitorset`, `monitoring` R74) and "Check for a new version now" (`monitor`) are two
 * acts (R15). A choice among record data (a question, a page) is `cs.choice` over `{value, text}` options (R8).
 *
 * R32 (T49): the capture's own grade object (its `heldcaptures` row, `provenance.captureGrade`), drawn as one mark, and
 * none at all where no read answers it (never "Unrated" beside a grade note); "Its versions" refused by its words; the
 * address an outside link, unquoted; the title the document's, never the address's last segment (R39); a testimony (a
 * member's firsthand observation, `op=testify`) offers Find in as a link and its words, and neither watching nor checking
 * for a new version; times by `cs.date`. Its reads gain the links the page carries (`links`, capture R57), the links it
 * makes into held documents (`links_to`, connections R24, its own references) and the mention that counts for each name
 * it holds (`on_point`, `connections`, connections R4); its acts gain `adoptversion` and `keepversion` (a newer version's
 * notice, reevaluation R15), `connectionchoose` and `explore`. Every sentence is a word by key (R44).
 * R49 (K3560): "In which question" preselects the question the capture was held for, never the group's first; the
 * document's own project's questions come first (passages section).
 *
 * T51 (R65–R70, R78): the screen follows the drawing's order (passages, Versions, "Your citations, leg by leg", "The record of
 * this copy", Fingerprints, What cites it, the links in five groups, the names with their grade and how they were matched,
 * Themes, Steps, the copy's own acts). R65 reads `bundlehistory` (the release, the log oldest first, the revisions, and two of
 * them side by side from the `image` answer the page already holds: no other read); R66 the fingerprints with Copy (`hashcopy`,
 * nothing sent); R67 the links by their verdict, an outside link opening a warning before its address (the browser acts
 * `linkopen`, `revisioncompare`: done in the page, nothing sent); R68 the names from `resolutions`; R69 one row for each
 * question that rests on the document, asked for a newer copy only when the member asks (`versionnotice`); R78 every page
 * drawn is the record's page + 1, every value sent is the record's own.
 *
 * CR-19 (R81, R82): the second "Read it" tab compares the revision a question cites with the current copy (matched by the leg's
 * `extent_capture` to `bundlehistory`'s `capture_sha`), by the browser act `revisioncompare`; the original-file card draws the
 * file's kind from the reading's format id and its size from `bytes`, and none without `bytes`.
 *
 * T51 fix round 2 (SCREENS-INQUIRY #18): R125 (C31) `cite` sends `{project, role, found}` in the body, the question choice redraws (`ui.citeQuestion`)
 * and the passage a question holds a leg on is marked as cited by it; R123 (C33) a held copy offers no retire, only a door to Held (BOB B26), and
 * `retire`'s `CITED` and `ILLEGAL_TRANSITION` are drawn in their own sentences (the citing questions as references; never the release act's);
 * R55 (C40) `attest` asks the co-archive for a public https address and says which of the two confirmations is missing; R124 (C42) `adoptversion`
 * only where the newer copy was captured and has a reading chain (`moveOffer`); R3 (C95) the cite picker's search box, titles and dates; interface-shell
 * R111 (C94) members by `cs.memberName`; R96 (C17) "Read N of M words"; R126 (`resolvetestify`) and R127 (`contradictionflag`), DEC-394 (3d, 3e);
 * R117 (C41) a refused version names its unplaced legs by their documents' titles. */
