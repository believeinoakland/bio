/* action-plans — the action plan (requirements: `build/requirements/action-plans.md`; `BIO_Action_v0_1.md` §3, §4):
 * a project's working material for deciding what to do about one or more matters, an inquiry still open (suspected)
 * or a determination's outcomes (determined). It holds options the assistant suggests or a member adds, each bound to
 * the matters it serves; the member's choice of which to pursue; up to three scenarios laying the chosen options out
 * over time, with checkpoints a member judges; and the link from each started option to the Action it created.
 *
 * A new module (T18, layer 9, last): nothing moves from the legacy modules. Escalation's record-object pattern is the
 * model (its index.mjs and doc.mjs).
 *
 * WHAT IT DECIDES, AND WHAT IT NEVER DOES. Every fact about a matter is read through the module that owns it (an
 * inquiry's state and the projects drawing on it through `inquiry` and record-core, a determination through
 * `conformance`, a standard through `standards`, an action through `actions`, an escalation through `escalation`, what
 * is available through `filings`, the project's bar through `strength`); support, liveness, phase starts and the checks
 * are derived when read, never stored (R8, R15, R19). A machine proposes (R11, R31) and nothing else (R24, R33): every
 * other act is a named member's. A checkpoint is the group's own intention and never a finding about the government
 * (R23). Nothing here holds a cost, budget, assignee, hours or significance score (R26), and no place is named in its
 * behaviour or text (R28). A plan is never published (R25): it is read only through this module's reads, by a viewer
 * who may see its project, and answered to anyone else as an id that names nothing (R22).
 *
 * THE RECORD OBJECT (R2, R27). A plan is a document of type `action_plan` under a `PLN-` id, promoted through
 * `promotion` like any record object, so it has history, audit and export. Each act is one promotion that appends one
 * entry to the document's Plan Log; the tables are that log's projections, written by the module's registered
 * projection inside the promotion's transaction. The module's registered check refuses any other promotion of a plan
 * document (only a replay restores one), so an act and a raw promotion cannot disagree about what happened. Proposals
 * are stored apart (R11), since any credential may make one, and are never part of the plan's document.
 *
 * REACHED as `actionPlansOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host, created on the first call with `deps`, returned
 * to every later caller. At creation it migrates its tables (idempotent), declares them to purge (R27), registers its
 * step with promotion (R21's check included), and registers its planning-run check and run listener with ai-runs (R30,
 * R32).
 * `deps` (each reached through its factory on the same host unless given; a test passes its own):
 *   record, membership, promotion   layer 2: `allocId`, `transact`, `head`, `readFile`, `livePaths`, `declarePurge`;
 *                                   `inSight`, `sight`, `existenceAct`, `projectAuthority`, `memberFacts`; `promote`,
 *                                   `registerStep`.
 *   inquiry        `projectsDrawingOn` (R1: the projects drawing on an inquiry).
 *   strength       `projectBar` (Terms: `short` support).
 *   conformance    `determinationRead`, `determinationsFor` (R1, R5, R8); its `noSuchDetermination`.
 *   standards      `standardRead` (R12's `enforces`, R19).
 *   actions        `actionCreate`, `actionRead` (R6, R15, R18); its `contactNotAMember` and `contactId` (its R45; R18).
 *   clocks         action-clocks' `reminderSet` and `reminderRefused` (its R4; R18, R29).
 *   escalation     `escalationsFor`, `escalationRead` (R6, R15).
 *   filings        `availableActions` (shown beside legal options).
 *   aiRuns         `registerOpenCheck`, `onRunOpened`, `runFor`, `read`, `boundOf`, `consumeBound` (R30–R32).
 *   now            the instance clock, an ISO string (default: the wall clock, to the second). */
