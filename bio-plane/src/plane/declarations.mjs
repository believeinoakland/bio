/* plane R68 (T51 fix round; K4168, K4189): THE ASSEMBLY OF THE OWNERS' OP DECLARATIONS. Each module that declares ops
   exports `DECLARED_OPS` beside its ops map; the plane takes them by its own static imports of the modules it composes,
   never through `test-support`'s collector (`declaredOpsOf`, which imports later modules by path and is test tooling only,
   P4), and hands them once, before any table is read, to `op-declarations`' and `op-grades`' registration (their R80, R49).
   An op declared by two modules stops the start naming the op and both modules; an owner's row that disagrees with a hand
   row stops it with the op named, as the registrations refuse it. The plane's own rows (`./declared.mjs`) are an owner's.
   ES modules cannot list their imports, so the import lines below are the list; `declarations.test.mjs` holds them to
   `build/modules.json` (every module whose source exports `DECLARED_OPS` is here, or the test names it). */
