/* plane R75, R77 (T51 fix rounds 4 and 4b; C5c; K4429, K4487; amends R4, R76; acquisition R96 and R100, extraction R80 and R82,
   control-plane R120 and R123): THE OWED-WORK LEDGER, FINISHED BY THE OBJECT'S OWN ALARM. A request is answered inside the door's
   bound and the Durable Object keeps no promise alive after it, so work that will not end inside the bound is written down
   here, in the object's storage, and finished by one `scheduler` consumer, `pending-work`. The table is `keeps_pending`, one row
   for each `(sha, kind)`; the kinds are
     `keep`          the whole is not yet put; `parts` are the part digests in order (acquisition R96); put by
                     `evidenceStore().putFromParts` (record-core R87), then read, in the same tick;
     `reading`       the whole is held and its reading is owed (control-plane R120, R123), by `extraction.readHeld`;
     `ocr`           pages of a scan left unread (extraction R82), continued by `extraction.readHeld({sha, kind: "ocr"})`, which
                     answers `owed: true` while pages remain;
     `subresources`  a web capture's outstanding supporting files and pending render, keyed by the capture SESSION (acquisition
                     R100), run by `acquisition.owedRun(cap, {kind, session})`;
     `unpack`        an archive stopped by a budget (acquisition R100), run as the unpack drain does, `op=unpack` as the daemon;
     `fetch`         a large web capture handed to the alarm (fix round 6, G2; acquisition's `owedFetch`), keyed by the capture SESSION as
                     `subresources` is, heavy: its body is read and its document filed by the alarm, never inside the member's request;
     `scan`, `safe_view`, `grade`, `ingest`  (fix round 9, R97) the job kinds of the safety scan, the safe view, the grade and the money
                     ingest, run by the owner the composition hands for each (`workers`); with none the row stays owed, `NO_OWNER`.
   An entry ends only when its work is done, or when its owner answers a FINAL reason (`final: true`, with its `why`), which the
   row then keeps, stated, for the document's page (op `owedwork`); never by a count or a clock. A failure, `NO_HOME` among them,
   leaves the entry for a later alarm, backed off from `PENDING_RETRY_MS` doubling to at most `PENDING_RETRY_MAX_MS` and going on
   at that rate. A second registration of the same entry re-arms it (no attempts, due now), a final one too.

   THE JOB TABLE (fix round 9, G126, G129c-e; R97, R98, R101; K4835 (2), K4837). `keeps_pending` is the job table of the reading kinds:
   beside R77's columns each row states its `state` (`queued`, `fetching`, `reading`, `partial`, `refused`, `finished`, `final`), the plan
   step's `verdict` on the bound, its `cursor`, the counters `written`, `skipped`, `owed`, `failed` (with `failed_why`, by cause),
   `last_progress_at`, `rate_per_s`, `carrier`, `reader_version` and `priority` (`raised` is "Read it"). A row that ended stays, `finished`,
   `refused` or `final`, for the readers of the table (`readingsEnded`); the member's page lists the work still owed and the ends stated.
   Every way in writes its row through ONE registrar, `registerJob(entry)`, SYNCHRONOUS (a write on the object's own SQL storage, so a
   caller makes it inside the function it hands `core.transact` and the row commits or rolls back with its filing) and never throwing;
   arming the alarm is the separate `armJobs()` after the commit. A row ends only when its counters say nothing is owed, never because a
   hook was called (G126j).

   THE RUN IS COUNTED BEFORE IT HAPPENS (fix round 5, E2; K4530; fix round 9, R101). An owner that kills the isolate (memory, CPU) never
   returns, so the ledger cannot learn of it from an answer. A row is stamped `started_at`, its try counted and its back-off set, and the
   UNIT it is on (the page or piece its cursor names, else the whole) stamped in `job_unit_attempts`, before its owner runs; every answer
   clears both stamps. A row found started and not finished at a later tick, by an isolate that is not running it, is an interrupted run:
   counted in `interrupted` (kept across a re-registration, never ending the row), and its unit counted one kill. A unit killed twice is
   asked once more at half the budget; a unit killed three times is stated unread alone (a page: `PAGE_KILLED_READER`, handed to the reader as
   `killedPages`; a window its cursor names: handed as `killedCursor`, which the reader steps past, K4904) while the row goes on with the rest;
   the whole of a file read with no cursor has no unit to leave out, and is the row's own end, stated.
   "Three interruptions end the whole read" is retired. A step that moved neither its cursor nor any counter ends the row `final`,
   `NO_PROGRESS`, on that tick (R101 (1)); a transient failure is tried again, never written as the end (R101 (3)). A tick runs the
   light kinds (`subresources`, `unpack`, `grade`) and at most one heavy row, so one document's read never holds the object that answers
   every screen for the length of three.

   A ROW'S TIME IS ITS OWN (fix round 7, G67, G69; R91, R92). A row is stamped started at its OWN start (`now()` when it begins, never the
   alarm's instant, which every consumer and row of the tick shares), so `last_ms` is that row's elapsed time and no earlier row's. It is
   split: `wait_ms` the part spent awaiting a worker (a service binding, measured by the plane around the binding the owner is handed, the
   union of overlapping calls), `own_ms` the rest; the 10 s bar is `own_ms`'s. `last_mem` is NULL where the platform reports no memory
   (workerd answers zeros). The last run of each `(sha, kind)` is kept beyond the row in `keeps_last`. (R105, G123g) Each run also states
   what it cost: `max_stretch_ms`, the longest gap an event-loop meter of `LAG_EVERY_MS` saw while it ran; `rows_read` and `rows_written`, the
   SQL rows its statements touched (the platform's cursor counts); `units`, the units its owner wrote. Each is NULL when unmeasured.

   Lower modules cannot import this one (it is last in the order), so they are handed the registration at composition, as they
   are handed `cap.waitUntil`: `captureOf(ctx).registerJob(entry)` and `.armJobs()` (R98), and the older async hooks
   `.keepLater({sha, parts})` and `.owedLater({kind, sha, session?, parts?, detail?})`, which write the same row through the registrar
   and arm the alarm in one step, never throwing. The door's deferred reading arrives by the store-internal route `pendingadd`. An
   owner answers one of: `{ok: true, read: true}` or `{ok: true, done: true}` (ended, when nothing is owed), `{ok: true, more: true,
   detail}` or `{ok: true, owed: true}` (a stage ended, the rest follows), `{final: true, why}` (ended, stated), anything else (tried
   again). */
