/* plane R1, R4, R95, R102, R111, R114: the instance's Durable Object class. Its constructor builds the store by calling
   `store-assembly`'s `assembleStore(ctx, env, {deliver})` (R1) and holds no construction, route map or frame of its own: the
   one frame every store request passes is `store-door`'s `dispatch`, through the assembled store's. The class keeps what is the
   hosting platform's: the retirement of a room of another generation (R95), the RPC methods (R111, R114), `alarm` and
   `onAlarm` (R4), the watchdog's and the heal's hooks (R79, R102) and the headers an answer carries (R78, R96). It writes no
   row and answers no op itself (R9); the composition body moved to `store-assembly` (K5046 (a), K624). */
