/* op-grades — R38–R41 (T48; R32's pattern; N880, N882, N670, N1042, N1047, N1026, N1027, N1029, N1030, N1034, N1035,
 * N1043; K3149, K3203, K3206, K3207, K3211, K3278, K3280, K3282, K3284) and R39's three given rows: EVERY OP T48'S
 * OWNERS ADD, graded by R5 and R3 with `affordances` R12's totality holding over them, each grade read from its owner's
 * requirements as R13, R17, R22–R37 do: `action-replies`' quoting record, `following`'s proceeding dates, `plane`'s
 * translation of one passage, `instance-setup`'s update choices and notice, `ai-use`'s use over time, `explore`'s graph,
 * `standards`' proposals, `filings`' read, `action-holds`' pressure read, `action-plans`' ask, `connections`' step source
 * and `membership`'s mark of when a member last looked at Home. Data only: no op's behaviour is decided here (P6).
 *
 * `./index.mjs` spreads the tables into `RUNGS`, `RUNG_ABSENT`, `NON_ACTS` and `MACHINE_REFUSALS`. This file imports
 * nothing, so the spread closes no cycle. `actionreplyquoting` is an `ACTS` row on an action target (`affordances` R58),
 * so it has no `NON_ACTS` row and enters `MACHINE_REFUSALS` with its owner's code; every other op, `planask` included
 * (K3297: its subject is a plan), takes a `NON_ACTS` row, which gives `op-declarations` its `NEEDS` row. No vocabulary, prompt, consequence statement
 * or Irreversible weight is added. By R18 `phone` follows the rung or ground: every op here answers true (advisory;
 * nothing refuses by device).
 *
 * R39's: `translationdraft` leaves the `undetermined` ground (it is edited in ./t37.mjs, where its row stands), and
 * `groupdescriptiondraft` is a read (K4247): it takes no row here, and its NON_ACTS reason is its owner's word (R51).
 * `securitymap` is a read, not an absence (K4210): its NON_ACTS sentence stands and no ground is given, since the owner
 * (credentials) declares it `read`. R42's `MARKS` is in ./marks.mjs. */
