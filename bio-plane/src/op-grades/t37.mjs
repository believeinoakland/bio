/* op-grades — R27 (N757, N776, N669, N708; DEC-157, DEC-180, DEC-182; K2171, K2200, K2201; T37): THE OPS T37 DECLARES
 * (`op-declarations`' T37 requirements) — `case-carriage`'s photo marks (DEC-180), `credentials`' own password change
 * (DEC-182 (4)) and a member's own Claude subscription sign-in (`agent-worker` R66), and `instance-setup`'s translation of
 * the interface (DEC-157) — graded by R5 and R3 with `affordances` R12's totality holding over them, each grade read from
 * its owner's requirements as R13, R17, R22 and R23–R25 do. Data only: no op's behaviour is decided here (P6).
 * `./index.mjs` spreads the three tables into `RUNGS`, `RUNG_ABSENT` and `NON_ACTS`. This file imports nothing, so the
 * spread closes no cycle. None of these ops is in `MACHINE_REFUSALS`, which holds only `affordances`' `ACTS` (R5,
 * `affordances` R20): `case-carriage` (`MACHINE_CANNOT_MARK_PHOTO`, its own code since T38, K2311), `credentials`
 * (`MACHINE_CANNOT_SET_PASSWORD`) and `instance-setup` (`MACHINE_CANNOT_TRANSLATE`) refuse a machine themselves. No
 * consequence statement, vocabulary or prompt is added. `subscriptionsignin` had no op and no grade in T35 (`./t35.mjs`);
 * it is graded here. (T38; R28) `obscuremark` left `T37_RUNG_ABSENT`: a withdrawal (`obscuremarkwithdraw`) takes a mark
 * back, so `./t38.mjs` grades it `reversible`; its reason stays here. */
