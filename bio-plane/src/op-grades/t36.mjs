/* op-grades — R23–R25 (K2092, K2130; T36): THE OPS `op-declarations` R31–R33 DECLARES — standards' in-force-through
 * records and calculations' spot-check visit (K2092), the 23 ops of `file-safety` (N714, N707, N710; DEC-169, DEC-173)
 * and `credentials`' keep-away (N721; DEC-172) — graded by R5 and R3 with `affordances` R12's totality holding over
 * them, each grade read from its owner's requirements as R13, R17 and R22 do; and `openwithwarning`'s consequence
 * statement (DEC-173 (2)), published beside its ground as beside a rung. Data only: no op's behaviour is decided here
 * (P6). `./index.mjs` spreads the four tables into `RUNGS`, `RUNG_ABSENT`, `NON_ACTS` and `CONSEQUENCE_STATEMENTS`. This
 * file imports nothing, so the spread closes no cycle. None of these ops is in `MACHINE_REFUSALS`, which holds only
 * `affordances`' `ACTS` (R5, `affordances` R20): `standards` (`MACHINE_CANNOT_DECLARE_STANDARD`), `calculations`
 * (`MEMBER_ACT_ONLY`), `file-safety` (`MACHINE_CANNOT_RELEASE_HOLD`) and `credentials` (`NOT_AN_ADMIN`) refuse a machine
 * themselves. `securitycount` is a store-internal route with no spec (`op-declarations` R6) and takes no grade (R25). */
