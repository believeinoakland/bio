/* ===========================================================================
 * FW-14 — THE WEIGHT LADDER, ASSIGNED TO EVERY MUTATING OP OR STATED ABSENT.
 *
 * WHAT THIS BLOCK IS FOR, and it is not the ladder. The value here is that
 * EVERY mutating op is ACCOUNTED FOR and a NEW one cannot arrive unclassified.
 * `unaccounted(opTable)` (`affordances` R12) takes the control plane's table of ops — each
 * `{op, mutating, gated}` — and answers the classification TOTAL IN BOTH
 * DIRECTIONS: no mutating op missing from RUNGS ∪ RUNG_ABSENT, and no key of
 * either naming something the table does not carry as mutating.
 *
 * THE ABSENCE HALF IS HALF THE DELIVERABLE, not a get-out. An op with no rung
 * and no statement is indistinguishable from an op nobody classified; CLAUDE.md
 * requires that undetermined be STATED. So `RUNG_ABSENT` is a required, checked
 * table, not a fallback — an op reaches `rung: null` only by being named there
 * with a ground.
 *
 * FW-14 superseded REC-19's "do not add a rung without a document": rungs are derived from the enforcement, and
 * the suite counts the mutating ops rather than this comment.
 * =========================================================================== */

/* THE LADDER, low to high, and it is PUBLISHED (vocabularies.rung_ladder) so a
 * surface reads the order rather than holding its own copy — DISPOSITIONS'
 * reasoning exactly.
 *
 * DEC-19 AS AMENDED 2026-08-03 IS THE AUTHORITY FOR THE TOP RUNG. Bob:
 * *"Publishing IS an irreversible act! It's (one of?) the only irreversible
 * acts."* Correction is always possible and always moves FORWARD — a new
 * edition (a separate document; all published editions stand), a withdrawal by
 * another attested act (both stand), a finding rescinded to an inquiry by
 * removing its claim. That path is stated BESIDE the rung, never instead of it.
 *
 * `terminal` IS RETAINED, AND THAT IS A JUDGEMENT MADE ON MEASUREMENT — read
 * this before removing it. DEC-19's 2026-08-02 half wrote that `terminal`
 * ("cannot be walked back") "no longer describes anything in the system",
 * reasoning from DEC-12: a published case may be revised as a new edition and a
 * closed finding may be reopened. That reasoning is about the rungs that were
 * then the ladder's TOP TWO. It was never checked against the state machine, and
 * the state machine disagrees: `STATES.information.edges.retired` is `[]`, so
 * `op=retire` moves a bundle to a state with NO outgoing edge and there is no
 * act in this catalogue that walks it back. With `irreversible` restored above
 * it, `terminal` is no longer claiming to be the top of anything — it is the
 * mid-ladder name for exactly what Constructs:161 called it, "internal, cannot
 * be walked back", which is what the code enforces. The rung is asserted against
 * that imported table in `affordances`' R19 test (`test/m/affordances/`), so if an
 * edge out of `retired` is ever added this rung fails rather than lying.
 *
 * WHAT SEPARATES THE TOP TWO IS NOT ABSENCE OF CORRECTION but its weight and
 * visibility: an `attested` act cannot be undone SILENTLY (every correction is
 * itself an act with a name and a date on it), and an `irreversible` act's
 * output never stops answering at all. */
export const RUNG_LADDER = ["reversible", "reasoned", "terminal", "attested", "irreversible"];

/* The correction path DEC-19 requires to be stated beside the top rung rather
 * than instead of it. Published with the ladder so a surface that renders
 * "irreversible" cannot render it without the sentence that makes it honest. */
export const IRREVERSIBLE_CORRECTION_PATH =
  "Publishing cannot be undone: what it published never stops answering. Correction always moves "
  + "FORWARD — a further edition (a separate document; every published edition stands), or a "
  + "withdrawal recorded as another attested act, with both standing in the record. Nothing is "
  + "erased, and nothing is un-said.";

/* THE REFUSAL FAMILY THAT BACKS THE `reasoned` RUNG. Constructs:161 defines the
 * rung as "a justification is required and never prefilled", and these are the
 * codes by which the store REQUIRES one. Read as a CLASS and not as one
 * spelling — REC-76's finding, and this table is where it bites: grading
 * `reasoned` by `NO_REASON` alone would have missed `op=release` (which demands
 * an acknowledgment AND a mitigation) and `op=conclude` (a conclusion AND a
 * falsifier), both of which are the same requirement wearing the word the act
 * uses for it.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT IN THIS FAMILY: `NO_TARGET`, `NO_SUCH_*`, `NO_ID`, `NO_KIND`,
 * `ENTITY_NO_LABEL`, `PROGRESSION_NO_LABEL`, `EXPERTISE_NO_LABEL` (the shared `NO_LABEL`, one code per site since
 * N285), `NO_CITATION`, `NO_BODY`, `NO_TITLE`, `NO_BUNDLE_MD`,
 * `NO_SIBLING_DISCLOSURE`. Those demand an OBJECT, an IDENTIFIER, EVIDENCE or a
 * well-formed document — none of them is the member saying why. A family that
 * swept them in would have graded nearly every op `reasoned` and the rung would
 * have meant nothing.
 * N364 (R1) MAKES ONE EXCEPTION, BY NAME, AND IT IS THE REQUIREMENT'S RATHER THAN A WIDENING HERE: a source's
 * disclosure, a claim that two sources are one person and a member's record of a source's consent are each an account
 * of what the member knows about a PERSON, and their account IS their evidence (sources R2, R6, R7: "evidence is
 * required"). R1 grades them `reasoned` on "a reason, or a question or conclusion, or evidence", so `sources'`
 * `NO_EVIDENCE` (C-121.3) joins the family. `NO_CITATION` and the rest above stay out. */

  /* ---- reversible: the plane PUBLISHES AN ACT THAT TAKES THE RESULT BACK.
     This is the only evidence accepted for this rung, and the reason is
     CLAUDE.md's: an outcome that costs nothing to produce is not evidence, and
     "I found no obstacle" is exactly that. `reversible` is a promise to a
     member, so it is assigned only where another act discharges it.

     `cite` IS C-7's ANSWER AND THE ROW'S CLAIM ABOUT IT HOLDS. The FW-14 row
     says this derivation method already yields C-7's answer; it was CHECKED
     rather than assumed. `cite` writes `{ rel: "cites", status: "confirmed" }`
     and `sever`'s `from` set is `["confirmed", "proposed"]` — so the act that
     takes a citation back accepts exactly what citing wrote. UI-20 recorded
     "C-7 derives reversible" and rendered the rung as ABSENT because FW-14 had
     not assigned it; it is assigned here, and the derivation agrees.
     Note what `reversible` does NOT claim: severing is not erasure — the edge
     stays in the record carrying `status: "severed"` and the member's reason.
     The act is undone; the fact that it happened is not. */

     MEMBER beside an object: it appears in `op=affordances` and a surface hosts
     it. No member presses this. In the background mode a run calls it unattended; in
     the interactive mode (§10) the member's act is "export", performed inside
     the session, and the plane call the session then makes is this one. Offering
     it beside an inquiry would tell a member they may compose a machine
     suggestion by hand, which is not a thing this record does — and would put an
     act on UI-52's register that no item owes a surface for.
