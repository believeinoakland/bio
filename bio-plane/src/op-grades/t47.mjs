/* op-grades — R36 (T47; R32's pattern; N972, N974–N977, N969, N955), R37 (T47's L11 fold, K3100; DEC-201, DEC-202,
 * DEC-205, DEC-207; K3061 D3) and K3104: EVERY OP T47'S OWNERS ADD, graded by R5 and R3 with `affordances` R12's totality
 * holding over them, each grade read from its owner's requirements and merged code as R13, R17 and R22–R33 do:
 * `project-roster`'s project list, `basis-versions`' project questions, `citation`'s drawn question, `strength`'s
 * project bar, `monitoring`'s watch, `credentials`' lock, password asked again and reset link, `instance-setup`'s logo
 * and languages, `tasks`' request to sign, the sign-in door's trace and `people`'s directory. Data only: no op's
 * behaviour is decided here (P6).
 *
 * `./index.mjs` spreads the three tables into `RUNGS`, `RUNG_ABSENT` and `NON_ACTS`. This file imports nothing, so the
 * spread closes no cycle. None of these ops is in `MACHINE_REFUSALS`, which holds only `affordances`' `ACTS` (R5,
 * `affordances` R20): each owner refuses a machine by its own code (`strength` C-32.9, `monitoring`
 * `MACHINE_CANNOT_SET_MONITORING`, `tasks` `MACHINE_CANNOT_ASK_SIGN`). Every op here, read or write, carries a `NON_ACTS`
 * row, so `op-declarations` gives each a `NEEDS` row (a present `null` for the public and session-own ones, K516's
 * precedent, as `recover`'s). No vocabulary, prompt, consequence statement or Irreversible weight is added. By R18
 * `phone` follows the rung or ground: the `credential` ones answer false (advisory; nothing refuses by device).
 *
 * `passwordresetlink`: R37 words it `reasoned`, but `credentials` R69 asks no reason, so no code would back the rung
 * (`affordances` R19); it is held here on the `credential` ground of the reset it opens, as `recover` (OP-GRADES #9 J1).
 * N955 adds no op: `credentials`' `aiRunCredentialMint` is in-plane and the door's op stays `airundispatch` (R33). */
