/* op-grades — R49, R50 (T51 fix round; K4165, K4168): THE OP DECLARATION, TAKEN FROM ITS OWNER.
 *
 * `registerDeclaredOps(owners)` takes each module's `DECLARED_OPS` (a frozen object from an op's name to its row) and adds,
 * for every op that has no hand row, the grade the row states to the very tables `./index.mjs` publishes, so `affordances`
 * (R12, R19, R20) and `phoneOf` read it as they read a hand row. An op that has a hand row must agree with its owner's row
 * in weight and description, or the registration is refused naming the op; the hand rows stay until each owner next declares
 * its own (K4168), so a row that agrees changes nothing. A registration is refused whole, and refused when any table was
 * already read: the tables `./index.mjs` exports are guarded (`guard`), and the first read through one closes registration.
 *
 * This file is built by `./index.mjs`, which hands it the raw tables; it imports only `setup-words` (R44), so it closes no
 * cycle (R19, R20). The row's other fields (`classes`, `machineClasses`, `fields`) are `op-declarations`'. */
