 * (`op-declarations` R42) AND EVERY OP `op-declarations` R41, R43 AND R45 DECLARES, with `actionseekspropose` (`actions`
 * R73), graded by R5 and R3 with `affordances` R12's totality holding over them, each grade read from its owner's
 * requirements as R13, R17 and R22–R28 do: `credentials`' project accounts and uses, `ai-use`'s limits and exploring,
 * `steps`, `investigation`, `hypotheses`' proposals and shares, `reading-guides`, `question-explorer`'s finds,
 * `run-productions`' acceptance and bearing notes, `case-authoring`'s account drafts, `review`'s approvals, `ai-runs`'
 * group tests, `capture`'s upload and `membership`'s handle. Data only: no op's behaviour is decided here (P6).
 *
 * `./index.mjs` spreads the three tables into `RUNGS`, `RUNG_ABSENT` and `NON_ACTS`. This file imports nothing, so the
 * spread closes no cycle. None of these ops is in `MACHINE_REFUSALS`, which holds only `affordances`' `ACTS` (R5,
 * `affordances` R20): each owner refuses a machine itself (`membership` R124 by `HANDLE_CHANGE_NOT_A_MEMBER`). By R18
 * only `projectkeyset`, `projectsigninset` and `projectaccountremove` (ground `credential`) answer `phone: false`. No
 * consequence statement, vocabulary or prompt is added. (DEC-188 (8)) `aiceilingset` and `aicopyceilingset` (retired to
 * `ailimitset`) and `accountswitchset` and `groupswitchset` (retired to `accountusesset`) left `./t33.mjs` and
