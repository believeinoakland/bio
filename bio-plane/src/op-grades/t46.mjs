/* op-grades — R33 (T46; R32's pattern; N897 (2), N919, N920, N654, N917; DEC-162, DEC-175; K2952, K2960, K2987): EVERY OP
 * T46 ADDS, graded by R5 and R3 with `affordances` R12's totality holding over them, each grade read from its owner's
 * requirements and merged code as R13, R17 and R22–R32 do: `instance-setup`'s information level, `plan-work`'s assistant
 * items for a status report, `escalation`'s stop and reopening, `ai-runs`' member-run door, `membership`'s doors read,
 * `action-clocks`' standing proposals and `agent-worker`'s text check. Data only: no op's behaviour is decided here (P6).
 *
 * `./index.mjs` spreads the three tables into `RUNGS`, `RUNG_ABSENT` and `NON_ACTS`. This file imports nothing, so the
 * spread closes no cycle. (`affordances` R52, amending R51) `escalationstoppursuing` and `escalationreopen` are `ACTS` rows
 * on an action target, so they have no NON_ACTS row here and are in `MACHINE_REFUSALS` (`./index.mjs`) with escalation's
 * code, `MACHINE_CANNOT_STOP`; every other op here is a non-act, none in `MACHINE_REFUSALS` (`ai-runs` refuses any caller
 * but the run's principal, `AI_RUN_NOT_PRINCIPAL`). By R18 `phone` follows the rung or ground. No vocabulary, prompt,
 * consequence statement or Irreversible weight is added: `words.json` (@ `3f40899950`) holds no consequence sentence for
 * stopping pursuit, which the design stream owes (K2960). */
