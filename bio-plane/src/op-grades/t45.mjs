/* op-grades — R32 (T45; the Actions fold, N893; K2569's pattern; the plan's reconciliation R1, R21): EVERY OP T45'S
 * OWNERS SERVE, the ops `op-declarations` R49 declares, graded by R5 and R3 with `affordances` R12's totality holding over
 * them, each grade read from its owner's requirements and merged code as R13, R17 and R22–R31 do. Data only: no op's
 * behaviour is decided here (P6).
 *
 * R32's rule: an act that requires an authored reason is `reasoned`, its refusal code in `JUSTIFICATION_REFUSALS`
 * (`./index.mjs`); an act a published act takes back is `reversible`; a member's own setting `caller-owned`; otherwise
 * `undetermined`. A recorded fact held as bytes or a member's account (a receipt, a notice sent, a pressure record) asks
 * no authored reason: R1's K1025 grounds class names its four ops by ruling, so none of these joins it. An approval
 * recorded at most once is `filingapprove`'s `terminal`; a record judged once, never re-judged, `checkpointrecord`'s
 * `undetermined`. The assertion resolution per sentence is `filings`' approval (reconciliation R1), graded there.
 *
 * `./index.mjs` spreads the three tables into `RUNGS`, `RUNG_ABSENT` and `NON_ACTS`. This file imports nothing, so the
 * spread closes no cycle. (K2885, K2887) The ten acts `affordances` R51 makes ACTS rows on an action target have no
 * NON_ACTS row here, and eight of them are in `MACHINE_REFUSALS` (`./index.mjs`) with their owners' codes; every other op
 * here is a non-act, refused a machine by its owner's own code where it is. By R18 `phone` follows the rung. No consequence
 * statement is added (R32: which acts take one is the UX stream's to propose); `publishcheck`, graded as `publish`
 * (case-check's Uses; K2839), carries the Irreversible weight by R21's rule. (T46; K2881) The five ops `op-declarations`
 * declared under R49 after this module's T45 merge (`grouprules`, `advocacycheck`, `advocacychecks`, `infractiondraft`,
 * `bearingdraft`) are graded here by the same rule; none is an act of `affordances` or a machine refusal (`case-account`
 * refuses a machine itself, `MACHINE_CANNOT_CHECK_ADVOCACY`). */
