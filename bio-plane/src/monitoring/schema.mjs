/* monitoring's tables (requirements: `build/requirements/monitoring.md`, R21, R13, R41, R52; K4). The first three moved

 * `monitor_fired` by `subject`; `monitor_tick_epoch` and `monitor_address_type` only by a whole-store purge, an
 * address outliving any one version. `monitor_address_frequency` (R52, K1019) holds members' acts, append-only, and is
 * declared to purge only by a whole-store purge for the same reason. `monitor_gathering_run` (R28, K1096), the record of
 * every attempt at a named request, is declared to purge by the bundle that carries the request. T24 (N506, K1159): the
 * link sweep's `sweep_runs` and `sweep_filed` left with the sweep for `link-sweep`, which creates and declares them. */

-- REC-26 / MACHINE-PROCESSES.md risk 2: the IDEMPOTENCE KEY for the two periodic
-- consumers that FIRE something (CAP-3's archive-monitor and REC-26's
-- monitor-cadence). It exists because a retry is not free here: an archive
-- fallback that succeeds calls recordCapturedLocator, which on conflict does
-- observations = observations + 1, and a run of observations across an interval
-- is the PRIMARY contemporaneity route (LINK-FIDELITY.md). So an alarm retry
-- that re-fires an address that already succeeded MANUFACTURES CORROBORATION —
-- three retries of one observation produce three observations. That is the
-- standing rule "an equality or an outcome that costs nothing to produce is not
-- evidence" landing in a table, not an optimisation.
--
-- One row per (consumer, subject) fired within one TICK EPOCH. The row is written
-- BEFORE the expensive act — taskEnqueue's producer-first dedup pattern — so a
-- subject that was fired and then lost to a throw is still recorded as fired.

-- The OPEN tick per consumer, and it is the half that makes the key above work
-- across an alarm retry. A retry arrives with a NEW Date.now(), so now cannot
-- identify the tick; the epoch has to be remembered. A row here means "a tick
-- started and did not finish cleanly", so the next tick REUSES its epoch and is
-- that tick's retry rather than a fresh one. It is deleted when a tick ACCOUNTS
-- FOR EVERY ELIGIBLE SUBJECT ITSELF -- nothing failed AND nothing was skipped --
-- which is what lets the NEXT cadence really re-check.
-- D-518, 2026-09-24: the second half of that condition is a CORRECTION. This line
-- read "when a tick completes with nothing failed", and so did the code, which
-- deleted the row on a tick that fired nothing and only SKIPPED subjects an
-- earlier unfinished tick had claimed. That tick learned nothing, and dropping the
-- row let the next wake mint a fresh epoch and re-fire an address that already
-- succeeded, inflating captured_locators.observations -- corroboration nobody
-- produced. The release is now the spent-epoch rule alone, one whole cadence on.

-- REC-191: THE CONTENT TYPE A MONITOR TICK LAST READ AT AN ADDRESS, which is what
-- the cadence plan falls back on when no version authored a frequency (the
-- contract sets the check frequency, BIO_Content_Framework section 6, and
-- CONTRACT_FREQUENCY gives it an interval). op=monitor determines the type on
-- every tick and, until this table, told only its caller -- so a document
-- stating no frequency read UNSCHEDULED in the plan though the tick had answered
-- it by its contract (D-65's worker finding a).
-- Keyed on the NORMALISED address, which is the key captured_locators and the
-- version chain use, so every version at one address shares one reading. The raw
-- address is kept beside it because a bundle with no captured address is matched
-- on its own source.locator, which is raw.
-- A row is replaced only by a tick that DETERMINED a contract, or when none is
-- held: an unreachable source says nothing about what the document is, so it
-- must not erase what an earlier tick read. content_type and contract NULL is a
-- tick that read the address and could not say, with basis saying why.
-- DERIVED from ticks over the corpus: a whole-store purge clears it. A per-bundle
-- purge does not, because an address outlives any one of its versions, the same
-- reasoning as source_reachability.
