/* monitoring — the daemon's watch over what the group's standing intent names (requirements:
 * `build/requirements/monitoring.md`; Intake Doctrine §4, §6): it checks each monitored document at its own cadence and
 * records what it saw as a look and a mechanical tick, never deciding what a change means; it fires the archive
 * fallback for a source that has stopped answering; it names Drive baselines that are shells; it guards the gathering
 * grammar; and it watches the clocks of the group's actions and what its objectives rest on.
 *
 * Extracted from the legacy modules (T8, layer 10; K3, K4, K6, K23, K31, K49, K61, K72, K102): `store.mjs` (`driveShells`,
 * the monitor's look and its address type, the archive-monitor tick, the idempotence key, the cadence plan and tick,
 * the two fires, the write-time gathering arm of the promotion step, the purge entries, the routes `driveshells` and
 * `monitorlook`), `index.mjs` (`op=monitor` with `monitorCadence`, `monitorAssess` and `monitorRecordLook`, now the
 * Durable Object service `monitor`, K72 (11)), `schema.mjs` (the three tables, now `./schema.mjs`) and
 * the legacy check catalogue (C-18.5, now `./checks.mjs`). The legacy code's comments moved with it. The record's
 * grammar it reads (the front-matter parser, the public-locator test, the one SHA-256, the machine stamp's prefix) is
 * `record-grammar`'s (T19).
 *
 * REACHED as `monitoringOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host, created on the first call. At creation it creates
 * its tables and declares them to record-core's purge (R41), registers the gathering grammar with promotion (R27) and
 * with record-core's audit (R42), and registers its proposal source with intent (R33, N170).
 *
 * THE SWEEP'S SEAM (R65, R66; N506, K1159): the link sweep is `link-sweep`'s, a later module this one never imports. It
 * runs its sweeps under `sweepHost()`, the services this module's own ticks use (one pause, one idempotence key, one
 * landing), and at composition hands back, once, through `registerSweep`, its share of C-18.5 (the sweep arm R27's check
 * and R42's audit read), its fence (asked last at the write) and its due sweeps for R30's slate.
 * `deps` (each reached through its factory on the same host unless given; a test passes its own):
 *   record, membership, promotion   layer 2: `readImage`, `getSetting`, `evidenceStore`, `declarePurge`,
 *                                   `registerAuditCheck`, `allocId` and `transact` (R28's landing); `inSight`,
 *                                   `viewerPredicate`, `isAdministrator`, `notAnAdmin` (R30), `isProjectOwner` (R52);
 *                                   `promote` (R8, R28, R34), `registerStep`.
 *   governor, provenance, capture   layer 3: `governorAdmit`/`governorReport` (through `governedFetch`); the receipt
 *                                   writer `recordReceipt`; `reachabilityThresholds`, `sourceReachability`,
 *                                   `recordSourceOutcome`, and `acquire` (its archive arm, R20; its capture-request
 *                                   arm, R28).
 *   observationLog                  its one append, `observe`.
 *   intent, actionClocks, escalation  R33 (`watchSet`, `registerSource`), R34/R44/R50 (`action-clocks`'
 *                                   `pendingClocks`, its R1; `actions` R31 before K617's split), R35
 *                                   (`escalationsDue`).
 *   publication                     R33's published-finding half (`restingCapturesOf`, its R42; N230).
 *   env      the instance bindings (`MONITOR_TICK_MS`). No binding or credential is a condition of monitoring (R45):
 *            both ticks call `monitor` and capture's `acquire` in process, from the scheduler's alarm (R23, N222).

/* ===========================================================   *  CAP-3: the ARCHIVE-MONITOR consumer (R20).
 *
 *  The decision half and the capture half of the archive fallback both work
 *  and are live-verified, and NOTHING invoked them: no periodic actor
 *  consulted `source_reachability` and nothing fired the fallback (the largest
 *  gap between what is built and what runs). This is the consumer that closes
 *  it: one entry in the scheduler's single reconciling alarm registry, NOT a
 *  second alarm and NOT a cron. SCHEDULER.md is the authority for why.
 *
 *  Each tick consults `sourcereach` for every document whose CURRENT failing
 *  run could reach the RULED threshold, and for those the fence finds
 *  `fallback_eligible` it fires the fallback by invoking op=acquire with
 *  via:"archive.org" and the DOCUMENT address — the SAME op a caller uses, so
 *  the two-hop grade-C chain, the re-checked eligibility fence and the
 *  provenance hop built from the CDX record that call itself fetches are all
 *  produced by one code path that cannot drift (D-112). It calls capture's
 *  `acquire` IN PROCESS (R23, N222) as the daemon class, which the archive arm
 *  admits ("an operator or daemon credential, never a member's"), and spends no
 *  credential: it never leaves the Durable Object.
 *
 *  D-104 is load-bearing here and was read before this was written: a governed
 *  refusal is OUR OWN politeness declining and moves no failure counter, so a
 *  self-throttled instance never trips the fallback. The exclusion lives in
 *  `recordSourceOutcome`; this tick only reads the verdict that respects it.
 *
 *  RUNS ON EVERY INSTANCE (R45, N222): a document asking to be monitored is the
 *  group's standing intent, so no binding or credential is a condition of it.
 *  It was inert until an instance wired `env.SELF` and a daemon token, because
 *  both ticks went over the instance's own Worker; they now run in process from
 *  the scheduler's alarm. An administrator may PAUSE the daemon (R30): a paused

  /** REC-191 (R15) — THE SUBJECT OF A SCHEDULE IS AN ADDRESS, NOT A BUNDLE.
   *
   *  Bob, 2026-08-06 (D-220): *"Monitoring an ADDRESS is what a member means"*; monitoring a
   *  bundle is what this consumer did, so sixty captures of one calendar were sixty
   *  schedules fetching the same address sixty times. The monitored bundles are GROUPED by
   *  `captured_locators.address_norm` through the version-chain join (`versionChain`'s own
   *  join: `captured_locators` to `register` on the capture sha, one version per sha, in
   *  `first_retrieved` order with the sha as tiebreak), and each address becomes ONE row of
   *  the shape the plan reads.
   *
   *  WHICH VERSION IS CHECKED: the CURRENT one — the newest version at the address among
   *  those asking to be monitored, because op=monitor refuses a bundle that does not ask.
   *  A NEWER version that does not ask is not silently passed over: it is STATED on the
   *  row (`newer_unmonitored`), since a tick against an older baseline is then comparing
   *  with a capture the record has already superseded.
   *
   *  WHICH FREQUENCY GOVERNS — BOB #31's 22:03Z ruling (quoted on REC-191's row, cited
   *  until folded): *"the ADDRESS's own setting governs; where none is set, the CURRENT version's;
   *  never the shortest; a disagreement is STATED."* The address's own setting is R52's act (R17,
   *  K1019): its latest setting, when it names a frequency, governs over every version's and the
   *  row states it (`frequency_source: "address"`, `address_frequency`); a latest setting of
   *  null returns the address to the rule below; every setting is on the row as
   *  `frequency_settings`. Where none governs, the current version's AUTHORED
   *  `monitoring.frequency` governs; where it authored none, the CONTRACT of the content
   *  type the last tick read at the address (`monitor_address_type`, CONTRACT_FREQUENCY) —
   *  the tick's own rule (`cadenceFor`), so the plan and the tick agree. Other
   *  versions' authored words never govern and never shorten it; where they differ from the
   *  one that governs, the row carries `disagreement`.
   *
   *  WHEN IT WAS LAST CHECKED: the LATEST check of ANY monitored version, because every one
   *  of them fetches the same address; the address was looked at when any was ticked.
   *
   *  NOTHING READ YET: an address whose current version authored no frequency and whose
   *  type no tick has read is DUE NOW (`frequency_source: "unread"`) — the check is what
   *  reads it, the same reasoning as a never-checked document. A tick that reads and cannot
   *  say writes a row saying so, so this cannot recur for the same address. One that read
   *  NO document (unreachable, gone) writes nothing, and the address is then STATED
   *  unscheduled rather than retried on an interval nobody derived.
   *
   *  A BUNDLE WITH NO CAPTURED ADDRESS (promoted without a capture filed at an address)
   *  is its own subject, as before, matched to a type reading by its own `source.locator`.
   *  So is a bundle captured at SEVERAL addresses none of which is its `source.locator`:
   *  choosing one would be the plane inventing which document it watches.
   *
   *  R18 (K1051): a CONTRACT default is lengthened by the address's run of checks that found
   *  the substance unchanged (`monitor_address_type.unchanged_run`): one step up daily, weekly,
   *  monthly per ten, never past monthly, stated on the row as `volatility`. An authored or an
   *  address's own frequency is never lengthened, and nothing is ever shortened.
   *
   *  Each row also carries, for the act and the reads only (never on the plan's rows),
   *  `setting_address` (the normalised address a setting at it governs: the row's address, or a
   *  bundle scheduled as itself for holding no captured address, its own `source.locator`; R52)
   *  and `monitored_versions` (the versions that ask, at that address).
   *
   *  BOUNDED: four linear reads (the monitored bundles, the chain rows at their
   *  addresses, the type readings, the address settings), grouped in memory — no read per row. */

   *  alarm retry re-runs a tick from the top, so an address the previous attempt
   *  already fired is fired again. For the archive fallback that is not merely
   *  wasted work — a successful archive acquire records the captured locator,
   *  which on conflict does `observations = observations + 1`, and a RUN of
   *  observations across an interval is the PRIMARY route by which the record
   *  establishes that a link was contemporaneous (LINK-FIDELITY.md). Three
   *  retries of one observation therefore produce three observations, and the
   *  record claims corroboration nobody produced. `CLAUDE.md`: "an equality or an
   *  outcome that costs nothing to produce is not evidence." So this is not an
   *  optimisation and not politeness to the Internet Archive (though it is that
   *  too, and our appetite there is OURS — D-111); it is the rule, enforced
   *  structurally.
   *
   *  The key is (consumer, subject, tick epoch), and the pattern is taskEnqueue's:
   *  the producer writes the dedup row FIRST and the expensive act happens only on
   *  a fresh key, so a subject fired and then lost to a throw still counts as
   *  fired. `now` cannot be the epoch — a retry arrives with a new Date.now() —
   *  so the epoch is REMEMBERED in monitor_tick_epoch and the presence of that row
   *  means "a tick started and did not finish". The next tick reuses it and is
   *  that tick's retry; a clean tick deletes it and the next cadence really does
