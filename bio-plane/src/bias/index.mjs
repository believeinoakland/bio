/* bias — declared bias (requirements: `build/requirements/bias.md`). PL-12 / D-84, DEC-54, and the bias debt (D-86,
 * REC-207; K82 (3)). Moved from the legacy store at the module's extraction (T5-7); the set's checks and the C-26
 * family are `./checks.mjs`', the tables `./schema.mjs`'.
 *
 *   biasAdopt     the AUTHORED, ATTRIBUTED, REASONED act that puts a set in force, and the PIN taken at that instant
 *                 (R11, R12; DEC-88).
 *   biasManifest  the EFFECTIVE SET in force for a scope, its hash, and what it does NOT enforce (R13–R18, R24, R25).
 *   biasInhale    reading an outside policy: it SPLITS bars from bias, PUBLISHES the residue, and PROPOSES, never
 *                 installs (R19–R21). It holds no write path at all: no SQL, no transaction, no promotion.
 *   the promotion step: a malformed set never lands (R9), and the statements are projected and the pins moved to an
 *                 adopted revision in the promotion's own transaction (R10). The state edge is promotion's (its R15).
 *   the bias debt: work products later modules register (R33), swept against the lens now in force, settled by one
 *                 of three recorded acts (R35, R37, R38), read (R36), and disclosed, never blocking (R28).
 *   counts, uncleared, settled  what `queue` reads: the rows held (R42), the open debts with their recipients (R43)
 *                 and the debts settled since an instant, with what settled each (R44). The counts are registered
 *                 with record-core's `registerCounts` for `op=stats` and purge's proof (R46).
 *   migrate       this module's tables and columns, at every boot (R45).
 *
 * REACHED as `biasOf(ctx, deps)` (K61): one instance per Durable Object storage, created on the first call with `deps`
 * and returned to every later caller. `deps`:
 *   record      record-core, `recordOf(ctx)` unless a test passes its own.
 *   membership  membership, `membershipOf(ctx)` unless a test passes its own.
 *   promotion   promotion, `promotionOf(ctx)` unless a test passes its own; this module registers its step and its
 *               post-commit notice with it on first reaching it.
 *   entities    the subject registry (`has(entityId)`, entities R7), for R25: `entitiesOf(ctx)` unless a test passes its
 *               own; `null` is no registry, and R25 then answers undetermined.
 *   env         the instance bindings: `BIAS_DEBT_DELAY_MS` (R41) and `BIAS_DEBT_BATCH` (R33).
 * The ops (`biasmanifest`, `biasadopt`, `biasinhale`, `biasdebtresolve`, `biasdebt`) are `biasOps`' entries, which the
 * plane's op map spreads in (`src/plane/store.mjs`).
