/* ratification — the Worker half of the two ceremonies (K3): `op=caseratify` (R2, the case document) and `op=ratify`
 * (R4–R6, a finding or its evidence), moved from `legacy-index` in T8. Each verifies everything at the control plane
 * (the fences, the signature, the gate), commits through this module's store half (`./index.mjs`, reached over the
 * Durable Object as `casedocfacts`, `casegate`, `caseratify`, `gatefacts`, `image`, `list`, `ratifygate`, `publish`,
 * `reusedparts`, `recordreuseverdicts`, `capturelimit`), and then copies the ratified bytes to the published store.
 * `op=caseratify`'s refusals before a signature exists are `./refusals.mjs`'s, the ones R18's pre-flight answers.
 *
 * Routing, authentication and the response envelope stay the control plane's. What it decided is passed in (`ctx`):
 * the caller class (`cls`), the minted agent credential (`aiCred`), whether the caller arrived through a member's own
 * session (`viaSession`) with its viewer and session row (`sessViewer`, `sessRights`), the store's name and bindings,
 * and its helpers — `json`, `doAnswer`, `storeSilent`, `storeRefusal` (when the caller hands it), `STORE_SILENT_REASON`/
 * `_DETAIL`, and a service of a module this one does not use directly: bias's gate arm (`withBiasChecks`).
 * The case container's assembly is public-read's (R6), imported; a caller may hand its own as `assembleCaseContainer`
 * (the module's tests do). `stub` is the Durable Object stub the op is scoped to. The legacy code's comments moved with

       is set only by the session lookup in the admission block; every class
       `classify()` resolves from an env binding leaves it false, so the fence covers
       ADMIN, MEMBER and PROBE today and any binding added tomorrow, and no token

         - BEFORE `do/publish` commits, a silence refuses the whole act with

           and 502 saying "nothing here is a statement about the record" is
           exactly true.
         - AFTER it commits, a silence may NOT refuse, because a ratification
           genuinely LANDED and 502's own sentence would then be false in the
           other direction. So the post-commit sites keep the true `ok:true`
           answer and state the UNDETERMINED part IN ITS OWN FIELD.

       Every post-commit conversion is byte-identical on the wire when the
       store ANSWERS: the new fields appear only on the path that previously
       lied, so no consumer of a working instance sees anything move.
