/* ratification — the bulk retirement (R28–R31, R33; K653 BOB-3): the verified-to-retired transition of many Information
 * documents at once, over a selection, at weight `refuse` (State Rules v1.5 §4.1: a retired item is not citable, and
 * `retired` is terminal). Extracted from `legacy-store` in T19 layer 8 (`Store.retire`, `#retirementCitedBy`,
 * `EDGE_REASON_MAX`; its `CITED` detail is `promotion`'s `RETIRE_CITED_DETAIL`, the words `promotion` R16 answers),
 * as the bulk release was in T18 (`./release.mjs`, whose `moveMember` writes each member here too); the plane's op
 * map (`plane/store.mjs`) reaches it through `ratificationOps` (§12.2). The legacy code's comments moved with it.
 *
 * S-11 step 4: bulk RETIREMENT of Information, weight `refuse`.
 *
 * Heavier than step 3's disposition for one structural reason: `retired` is TERMINAL in the catalog's table (collected
 * -> verified -> retired, and retired -> nothing), where every Problem disposition is reversible. A wrong disposition
 * is corrected by disposing again. A wrong retirement cannot be undone through the state machine at all, so every
 * refusal here is worth more than the equivalent refusal there.
 *
 * TWO GUARDS, and the second is the doctrinal one.
 *
 * First, only `verified` -> `retired`, because that is the only legal edge. Retiring something merely `collected`
 * would skip the step where a human looked at it, which is precisely what the intake doctrine exists to protect.
 *
 * Second, INFORMATION A PROJECT STILL CITES IS REFUSED. Nothing in the catalog stops this, and that is why it matters:
 * C-6.2 treats an unresolvable reference target as an ERROR whose remediations are "restore target from history",
 * "re-point to the successor", or "sever the edge with a reason note". A bulk retirement that silently stranded live
 * citations would manufacture exactly that error condition at whatever scale the operator happened to select. The
 * citing Projects are NAMED, because an operator told only "refused" cannot act, and severing is C-6.2's own remedy.
 *
 * A SEVERED edge does not count as a citation. Severing is the recorded decision to stop relying on something, so
 * treating a severed edge as a live dependency would make the refusal unclearable by the very act doctrine prescribes
 * for clearing it.
 *
 * As built, no author's class is asked (a machine or absent author is not refused here, unlike the release's C-32.1),
 * and the refusals carry no catalogue row. `deps` is `{sql, promotion, retrieval, connections}`. */
