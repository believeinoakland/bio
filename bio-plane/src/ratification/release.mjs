/* ratification — the bulk release (R20–R27; N400, K583, K636): the collected-to-verified transition of many Information
 * documents at once, over a selection (Intake Doctrine §4, "What verification asserts, and batch ratification").
 * Extracted from `legacy-store` in T18 (`Store.release`, `RELEASE_ACK_MAX` and the two front-matter helpers it calls,
 * `#appendStateHistory` and `#setScalar`); the plane's op map (`plane/store.mjs`) reaches it through `ratificationOps`
 * (§12.2). The legacy code's comments moved with it. Since T19 layer 8 the bulk retirement (`./retire.mjs`, R28–R31)
 * writes each member through the same `moveMember` below, so the two transitions splice a document one way.
 *
 * S-11 step 5, the last rung of the ladder: bulk RELEASE of Information, collected -> verified over a selection, weight
 * `refuse`, whole set or nothing. Decided by Bob 2026-07-27 and specified in Intake Doctrine v1.2: what legitimizes a
 * bulk release is volume plus little-to-no variance in the trustworthiness of the collection, whatever origin brought
 * it in, because verification asserts only that a document APPEARS to be what it claims to be, never accuracy.
 *
 * Four properties carry the doctrine:
 * 1. A NAMED MEMBER authors it. The author stamp arrives from the session; a machine credential's stamp is refused by
 *    shape, because the collected-to-verified transition is a member's decision (section 4, C-18.1), whatever else
 *    machines may prepare.
 * 2. The ACKNOWLEDGMENT IS A RECORD, not a dialog. The member's explicit acknowledgment of the batch's homogeneity and
 *    the mitigation steps they actually took are required parameters, refused when absent, and written into every
 *    released document's Session Log, so a batch release is permanently distinguishable from a per-document one.
 * 3. CRUCIAL NEVER RIDES A BATCH. Ratifying crucial-criticality material requires verifying its co-attestations
 *    (doctrine section 3, F4), which is per-document work, and a batch containing crucial material is by definition not
 *    a low-variance collection.
 * 4. NOTHING VERIFIED HERE AUDITS DIRTY. The verified-state entry requirements — C-2.7's (well-formed content_hash,
 *    data/dataset.json, a file in snapshots/) and, as of REC-54/D-200, C-18.9's provenance chain — are checked per
 *    member BEFORE any state moves, offenders named, set refused whole (R27).
 *
 * It reads record-core's `bundles` and `files` (its R37 read contract) and writes only through `promotion`'s `promote`
 * (R24, and R30 for the retirement). `deps` is `{sql, promotion, retrieval, contradiction}` (R22's contested arm
 * reads `candidatesFor`). A refusal with a catalogue row (C-32.1, C-33.10–C-33.12, copied into `./checks.mjs`'
 * `RELEASE_CHECKS`; C-58.4, in `RATIFY_SCOPE_CHECKS`) carries its `code`, `check` and `translation` (DEC-49). */
