 * The interface's words as a list; the team's translation of each word into any language, kept by a granted speaker,
 * with every earlier text still readable; the grants that let named members translate; the assistant's drafts, stored as
 * labeled machine work that no member outside the workspace sees; the second check a protected word waits for; the undo;
 * the marks "this translation looks wrong"; the words in a member's language, never blank; and which language a passage
 * is read in. Requirements: build/requirements/translations.md (R1–R20). Built by copy from `instance-setup` (R67–R75,
 * R87; K624, N1084, P6; `build/extraction/translations.md`), its SQL unchanged; `instance-setup`'s copy is deleted in its
 * own job (T50-23).
 *
 * SHAPE (K61, R12). `translationsOf(ctx, deps)` answers the one instance for a Durable Object's storage. `deps` is read
 * on the first call: `record`, `membership`, `aiAccounts`, `jurisdictions` and `now`, each defaulting to the module's own
 * factory on the same `ctx`. At its creation it creates its seven tables and declares them to record-core. It calls no
 * later module: the member's own language (`instance-setup` R64) reaches it by the registration of R11. */
