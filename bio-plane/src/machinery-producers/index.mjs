  /* ================== REC-32 · the CONDITION half of the feed =======   *
   * WHAT A CONDITION IS, and it is the reason this class exists separately: a
   * fact about OUR OWN MACHINERY rather than about the world (NOTIFICATIONS.md,
   * "The classes"). An overdue set of minutes is evidence about a public body;
   * a governor holding a host is a limitation of our own run. Merging them
   * would let our plumbing dilute the record's findings, which is the one thing
   * the three-class split exists to prevent.
   *
   * DERIVED ON READ, NO TABLE, NO STORED STATE — the REC-20 precedent, and here
   * it is not a shortcut but the only correct shape. Every one of these facts is
   * ALREADY state on the producing subsystem's own row: the governor's
   * `cooloff_until`, the capture session's existence and expiry, the manifest's
   * author. A stored copy would be a second record of one fact and would go
   * stale the instant the fact resolved — which is exactly the failure this
   * item's negative control produces on purpose.
   *
   * SO RESOLUTION NEEDS NO MECHANISM. A condition clears when its underlying
   * fact stops being true, for EVERY member at once, because there is nothing
   * per-member to clear: the hold expires, the session is dropped, a member
   * authors the document again. That is DEC-16's one-state-N-homes rule
   * inherited rather than re-implemented, and it is why muting (personal) and
   * resolving (shared) can sit on the same item without colliding.
   *
   * EACH KIND IS ONE WHOSE DATA IS ALREADY HERE (R2's six, R4's five, R5's three).
   * Each is built because its producing subsystem already writes the fact
   * down, and nothing here invents one. NOTHING IS COUPLED TO A MONITOR TICK:
   * a later producer adds kinds, it does not change these.
   *
   * THE VIEWER POSTURE IS REC-30'S, arm for arm:
   *   - a condition ABOUT A BUNDLE the viewer may not see is WITHHELD WHOLE and
   *     with no count, the posture an OBLIGATION about an invisible subject
   *     takes — a count here would say a project exists;
   *   - a condition about something that is NOT a bundle (a host, an
   *     unregistered capture) stands for every member, because it names no
   *     bundle to withhold; what is gated is which DOCUMENTS sit behind it;
   *   - the homes come from `homesOf` (queue R7), so an ancestor the viewer may not
   *     see is `undetermined`/`out_of_view` and never silently dropped.
   * ======================================================================== */

  /** The home set for a condition, with the ONE extra way a condition's walk can
   *  come back incomplete that an obligation's cannot.
   *
   *  An obligation and a finding both start from a bounded, known set of
   *  subjects. A condition about a HOST does not: the documents it concerns are
   *  every document captured from that host. So the subject gathering carries
   *  R2's discipline too — a bound, and an EXHAUSTED bound reported as
   *  `subject_bound` rather than as a quietly shorter home set. Same rule as
   *  `depth_bound`, same reason, and deliberately a DIFFERENT word, because

   *
   *  AN ADDRESS BELONGS TO THE HOST WHEN IT BEGINS WITH ONE OF FOUR PREFIXES, since normalizeAddress keeps the

   *  and it is a seek on the `address_norm` key. No LIKE or GLOB pattern is built (N270): a pattern grows with the

  /** `capture-completed-unattended` (D-61, closed by REC-2).
   *
   *  THE FACT IS THE MANIFEST'S OWN, and REC-2 is what made it exist. Before
   *  REC-2 an unattended writer could not take a lease at all, so a daemon
   *  could not finish a capture a member walked away from; REC-2's answer was a
   *  NAMED machine actor, `token:<class>`, stamped by the control plane with the
   *  caller's own value deleted first. That stamp lands on `manifest.author`,
   *  and it is the only durable trace of an unattended write anywhere in this
   *  store.
   *
   *  THE CONDITION IS THE SEQUENCE, NOT THE STAMP. A document written only ever
   *  by a machine was never walked away from by anybody — the whole intake path
   *  runs on a machine credential. What D-61 describes is a PERSON's document
   *  finished by a daemon, so the test is: the LATEST snapshot was machine
   *  written, and an EARLIER one was authored by a person. Both halves are
   *  required and the basis names both.
   *
   *  IT RESOLVES WHEN THE MEMBER COMES BACK — that is, when a person authors the
   *  document again and the latest snapshot is theirs. Shared, like every other
   *  condition here, because it is a property of the manifest and not of a
   *  reader.
   *
   *  ORDERING. `created` is the DOCUMENT's own time (promote records
   *  meta.last_updated, never the wall clock — C-12.1 depends on that). The
   *  tiebreak is `rowid DESC`, the store's own write order, because `snap_key`
   *  is an opaque caller-chosen string and its lexical order is not a clock: two
   *  snapshots stamped at the same instant would otherwise be ordered by a hash.
   *  #revisionKind reads the latest manifest entry by this SAME order since
   *  D-171 (it tiebroke on `snap_key DESC` until then, and named the wrong
   *  writer on a tie); the two sites agree on purpose. */

  /** `capture-completed-unattended` (D-61) — ITS SECOND PRODUCER, and PL-4's
   *  completion notification.
   *
   *  THE DESIGN SAYS *"extend the subscriber, do not invent a channel"* (§4, on
   *  the pursue session waiting on a capture), and this is that: the SAME
   *  catalogued kind, the same class, a different subject and a different basis.
   *  A second producer for one kind is not novel — `C-27.13` has two, and PL-3's
   *  own control arm 6 turns on the distinction.
   *
   *  WHY THE FIRST PRODUCER CANNOT COVER THIS CASE, stated rather than left to
   *  be discovered. `#conditionsCaptureUnattended` requires an EARLIER manifest
   *  entry authored by a PERSON — its whole condition is "a person's document
   *  finished by a daemon". A requested capture was never a person's document:
   *  the run asked for a URL nobody had captured. So the walk finds no `started`
   *  row and correctly emits nothing, and the member waiting on this capture
   *  would be told nothing at all.
   *
   *  WHAT IT NAMES: BOTH PRINCIPALS, through the one composer the drain used. A
   *  row whose attribution cannot be composed emits NO ITEM — a notification
   *  that could not say whose act it was would be the defect DEC-27(b) names,
   *  surfaced to a member.
   *
   *  RECORDED FOR THE NEXT READER: the plan row and INVESTIGATIVE-SESSION.md §4
   *  both call this "the existing FINDING-class slug". IT IS NOT ONE.
   *  `queuestate.mjs` has classed `capture-completed-unattended` as a CONDITION
   *  since REC-32 and has a live producer for it. It is built here as the
   *  CONDITION it actually is rather than reclassified to match the prose: a
   *  kind's class decides whether leaving the list is a personal mute or an
   *  authored record act (D-125, DEC-16), and moving one to match a sentence in
   *  a plan would be changing doctrine to fix a citation. The discrepancy is
   *  reported rather than silently absorbed. */

   *
   *  THE FACT IS THE REQUEST ROW'S OWN: a request that asked for the page as a visitor saw it (`render = 1`) and
   *  carries a C-83 code. While it is `requested` the drain is HOLDING it under that code (D-491) and asks again on
   *  every tick until its `expires`; once `expired` the drain has RELEASED it and the render never happened. Both
   *  are shown, under one kind, because they are one fact at two moments and a member who saw the first must be
   *  able to see how it ended — an item that simply vanished at expiry would be the silent drop the ruling forbids.
   *
   *  THE REASON IS C-83's OWN, in DEC-49 words: the code, its C-number and the canned translation are read off the
   *  family that minted them and never re-typed here, so the sentence a member reads is the one the plane refuses
   *  with. C-83.3 and C-83.4 say different things — one that this instance cannot render at all, the other that
   *  today's allowance is committed — and collapsing them into "deferred" would tell a member to wait for a
   *  renderer that is not coming.
   *
   *  A CONDITION: our renderer, our allowance and our pacing hold it, so it is a fact about our machinery and never
   *  about the page, and a member may mute it for themselves (D-125's item form). It offers no act of its own; the
   *  options are the acts on the question the request was asked under, derived as every other item's are.
   *
   *  GATED AT THE TARGET through `#bundleGate`, exactly as the completion notification one producer up is: a
   *  request under a question the viewer cannot see is absent from their feed as it is from op=capturerequests. */

         same host wins the slot, and that overwrites the row's code (measured, capturerequests.test.mjs 7d) — so
         showing C-83 codes alone would make the item VANISH for a tick while the render still waits, which is the
