/* signin-door: THE SUBSCRIPTION SIGN-IN DOOR (R1–R6; T47-91; N1001; connect §3), split by copy from `control-plane`
   (its R65, R78, R85–R87; K617, K624). This file is the door's Worker half: what `control-plane` calls when it routes
   `subscriptionsignin`, `subscriptiondisconnect`, `signintrace`, a member's revocation and an ask's or draft's answer.
   The store's half (the in-plane `credentials` calls and the bounded trace) is `ops.mjs`, a store-internal map.

   R1 (was control-plane R65; N708, DEC-156): A MEMBER'S OWN CLAUDE SIGN-IN, RELAYED TO THEIR OWN RUNNER. A step reaches
   agent-worker's `POST /signin` through the `AGENT_WORKER` binding as `{member, step, code?}`: `member` the door's stamp
   (the session's `by`), never a value the caller sends; `step` and `code` the request body's alone. Who reaches the op
   (a member's own session only) is `admission`'s, before this module is asked. `start` and `code` are refused while the
   group keeps its material away (`ai-accounts.aiKeptAway()`, its R7, asked through the store-internal `aikeptaway`), nothing
   sent. The runner's answer is relayed as given, status and body; a `code` answer carrying `connected: true` for that
   member and no token is recorded through `ai-accounts.subscriptionConnected` (its R18; `subscriptionconnected`), and only then.
   The member's own `subscriptiondisconnect` and their revocation send `step: "signout"` for that member, and a runner
   that cannot be reached changes neither act's answer. The code is never logged, stored, echoed or answered here.
   `agent-worker`'s `RUNNER_NOT_CONFIGURED` is relayed unchanged, with a `translation` read by key.
   R2 (was R78; N981, K231): `start` is refused `DISCLOSURE_DUE` as `ai-accounts.disclosureDue({member})` answers it (its R23),
   relayed as given, after the keep-away refusal and before anything is sent; this module holds no row for the code.
   R3 (was R85): each request gets a `trace`, sent with `member_ref` in headers; one log line `signin.door`; `trace` in
   every answer.
   R4 (was R86; K3060 D10): on `code` the door sends `hold: true`; a `token` answered is handed to
   `ai-accounts.subscriptionTokenHold` (its R19) and its result read; `token` and `valid_for` never leave this module; the answer
   says `held: true`, or `held: false` with the fact's code. `state` is answered from
   `ai-accounts.accountReferenceState`'s `subscription` (nothing sent to the runner). Disconnect and revocation drop the
   token through `ai-accounts` (its own acts, R18, R27, R19) and send `signout`. An ask or draft answered
   `SIGNIN_TOKEN_REFUSED` calls `ai-accounts.subscriptionTokenRefused`.
   R5 (was R87): on a test instance only, a bounded trace answers `op=signintrace`; elsewhere `SIGNINTRACE_NOT_TEST`.

   THE INTERFACE. `store(path, init)` is the caller's ask of its record store, answered in `answer-envelope`'s
   `doAnswer` shape (`{answered, refused, result, reply, correlation}`); every answer here is `{status, body}`, which the
   door sends as JSON (`answer-envelope` decorates a refusal with its row). `log(line)` writes one log line (default
   `console.log` of the JSON). Nothing here throws. */
