   A REPLAY THE SERVER CAN VERIFY? The same test answers both: nothing below is particular to an inquiry or to a
   creation (`b.bundleId` is the bundle a revision revises too). Condition (2) of the ruling, asked of what the SERVER
   holds and never of what the caller says: the promotion names a capture (`provenanceCapture`, a sha256) that is
     - REGISTERED as the Drive era's provenance — at `DRIVE_PROVENANCE_PATH` — by this creation's own `register`
       list, the one writer of the register (`promote`) and so the earliest act that can register anything against
       a bundle that does not exist yet (the builder's DESIGN GAP, stated in the IC);
     - HELD: its bytes are read back from R2 under the one capture key and must hash to the sha named, so the
       provenance is the bytes already in the record, not a copy the request carries;
     - and its PRESERVED PROMOTION RECORDS name THIS bundle id (`record.target`) and, in THE SAME record, list THIS
       revision's `bundle.md` SHA-256 — computed here from the text being promoted, and the `sha256` the caller
       sent must BE that value, because the store keeps the caller's figure as the bundle's head.
   Null when any of it fails: a promotion that ASSERTED `replay` is then refused REPLAY_UNVERIFIED (C-66.6, D-512), and
   an inquiry creation that asserted nothing is an ORDINARY creation and rule 2 and D-78 apply unchanged, so this
   door cannot be used to skip a run. Condition (1), the ADMIN class, is the caller's to ask before calling this.

 *  `deliverOwedRender({ctx, env, storeName, answer, session}) -> {ok: true, bundleId, reading_pending?} | {ok: false, reason}`. (Fix round 6, G2; K4562:
 *  the plane's `fetch` entry, a large capture the member's act left to the alarm, hands its finished document here as well: the same promotion under
 *  the session's project, by its opener, and the same reading follow.)
 *  The rendered document is promoted as the capture screen promotes an acquired one: screens-intake's own `promoteDocument` builds the
 *  bundle (its text, id and register), run in process through the same `promote` step (promotion's `promote`, the route's own), filed
 *  under the project of the shell document (the capture session's primary, as its opener sees it) with the opener as author and
 *  the door's promote stamps; then R123's read of the document, inline when it fits, else written down for the alarm. Nothing is
 *  delivered for a session that is gone or has no opener; a refusal is `{ok: false, reason}` and the render stays owed. */
