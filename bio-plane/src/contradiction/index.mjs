/* contradiction (layer 6): Contradiction's IDENTIFY (`build/requirements/contradiction.md`;
   `docs/development/CONTRADICTION-IDENTIFY-DESIGN.md`). The pairing read (R5–R12) and the one door a run's judgement
   enters the record by (R13–R16), reached through `contradictionOf(ctx)` (K61). Moved from `store.mjs` (REC-146's
   pairing, REC-147's candidate door, their dispatch), `bio-checks.mjs` (C-60, C-93, now `checks.mjs`) and
   `schema.mjs` (`contradiction_candidates`, now `schema.mjs` here). The judgement's words stay in
   `../contradiction.mjs` and are re-exported here. Whether a run is visible, running and the caller's is asked of a
   run gate `ai-runs` registers (R21, K31), `legacy-store` registering until then.

   WHAT THIS IS AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT IT IS NOT. Section 2 splits the detector in two and the split is the whole
   audit story: PAIRING — which two assertions are worth comparing — is deterministic, in the plane, and auditable;
   JUDGEMENT — whether a pair conflicts, and how — is the machine's, inside a run, labelled machine work. This module
   pairs, and holds what a run PROPOSED about a formed pair. It judges nothing, grades nothing, edits or closes no
   side, and no read here shows a candidate to a member (R19: PRESENT and RESOLVE are not designed).

   THE ONE THING THIS SURFACE CAN GET WRONG THAT NOTHING ELSE CAN. `CLAUDE.md`: *sparse is normal at every level, and
   absence at one level is not evidence of absence at the next. Saying WHICH is true is a first-class obligation.* An
   empty pair list here is SIX different facts — nobody has asked a question; the questions hold no readings; the
   readings state no claim; the claims share no subject; the sources cannot be told apart for want of a date nobody
   recorded; or this caller was shown nothing at all. Printed bare, every one of them reads as THE RECORD IS
   CONSISTENT. So no key ever returns a bare zero: `absence` names the LEVEL and the ladder that found it is
   published beside it (R11).

   WHAT IT READS OF OTHER MODULES' TABLES, each in its own SQL so the per-key bound stays a bound on the statement
   (D-365): `bundles` (record-core R37), `content` (content R45), `readings.content_type` (extraction R58) and the
   reading's date through `extraction.readingOf` (R30), and `inquiry_basis`, `bundles.inquiry_subject_entity`,
   `inquiry_basis_versions`, `inquiry_basis_version_legs` and `resolutions` as their owners' read contracts
   (CONTRADICTION #1 QUESTION J1). */
