/* The XLSX registry entry (QUEUE COFF-3) — the first real user of I7's
 * `parts` slot, built on COFF-2's container reader (ooxml.mjs) and COFF-1's
 * registry contract (formats.mjs, I7 CONFIRMED 1.0.0).
 *
 * WHAT IT EMITS, and where each piece of doctrine lives:
 *
 *   structure(parts) -> the I2 shape. Outbound links come from each sheet's
 *   `xl/worksheets/_rels/sheetN.xml.rels` joined to the sheet's <hyperlink>
 *   elements (the rels know the TARGET, the sheet XML knows the CELL), and
 *   land in the SAME four partitions HTML and PDF use through the ONE
 *   `linkWrapper` imported from subresources.mjs — never re-derived, the one
 *   way drift cannot happen (`pdfstructure.mjs` makes the identical move, and
 *   both suites pin the parity). Defined names and cross-sheet hyperlink
 *   locations -> `anchor`; `xl/embeddings/` -> `intra`, content-addressed by
 *   sha256 exactly as a bundle companion is; anything unresolvable ->
 *   a STATED `undetermined` carrying WHY, never dropped, never invented.
 *
 *   Element references are IC-1's resolved union (RESOLVED as amended,
 *   2026-08-03): `{ kind:"sheet-cell", ref:"Sheet1!B14", sheet, cell }` —
 *   `kind` the required discriminator, `ref` the human form the container
 *   knows, produced HERE so no consumer ever parses per-container syntax.
 *
 *   text(parts) -> the I2 text shape: `xl/sharedStrings.xml` + each sheet's
 *   cached <v> values (what the published sheet DISPLAYS), per sheet, with
 *   hidden sheets included AND flagged — the record holds what the file
 *   carries; hiding is a fact about the file, not a reason to omit.
 *
 *   THE EVIDENTIARY CORE (DEC-5), carried in the shared `evidentiary`
 *   envelope — IC-2 as ACCEPTED from COFF-4's as-built code (docx.mjs landed
 *   first; this entry CONFIRMS the envelope, inventing no variant):
 *     { container:"xlsx", kinds:[...], items:[{kind, source, ...}],
 *       undetermined:[{part, why, ...}], counts:{<kind>:n} }
 *   The <f> FORMULA is held BESIDE its cached <v> value as two named fields
 *   on one item — never collapsed, never substituted for the value in the
 *   text stream — because the derivation is frequently the finding and every
 *   rendered form of the sheet destroys it. Hidden rows, columns and SHEETS
 *   are emitted flagged hidden: a hidden sheet is a first-class finding
 *   invisible in every rendered form. `docProps/core.xml` rides the envelope
 *   as a `core-properties` item — the SAME kind name DOCX emits, so the
 *   provenance-adjacent metadata is one vocabulary across the office entries.
 *
 * THE CONFIDENCE LADDER for detect(), decided deliberately (the COFF-1
 * handoff requires it): detect is SYNCHRONOUS (the registry does not await
 * it), so it can walk the central directory but can never inflate
 * [Content_Types].xml. Therefore:
 *
 *   bytes, full container in hand : central directory readable AND
 *       [Content_Types].xml AND xl/workbook.xml both present -> "likely".
 *       Never "certain" from this seam — the flavour's declared main content
 *       type lives INSIDE a deflated part, and claiming certainty without
 *       reading it would be claiming what the bytes read so far do not say.
 *       parts() completes the discrimination through ooxml.mjs's
 *       discriminate() (magic + parts + declared type, confidence "high").
 *   bytes, a PREFIX only (the acquire-time 1 KiB seam): the central
 *       directory is out of reach, so the honest answer is NO ANSWER — a
 *       bare PK sniff must NOT claim xlsx (a renamed plain ZIP is not a
 *       .xlsx), and this entry returns null rather than a guess.
 *   content type only: the declared xlsx type -> "likely" at best, per the
 *       registry's own two-pass doctrine (a declared type is a claim).
 *
 * THE SIZE BOUND is COFF-6's measured metric, enacted in ooxml.mjs: 20 MiB
 * of DECLARED UNCOMPRESSED text-part bytes (sheets + sharedStrings), summed
 * from the central directory BEFORE inflation. It is what this entry may hold
 * in memory at once. Over it, up to ooxml.mjs's STREAMED_TEXT_BOUND_BYTES, the
 * text is READ IN PIECES (R35, F7): each sheet part is inflated in windows and
 * walked a run of whole rows at a time, so a sheet is never held whole and its
 * rows are consumed as they come; the typed `cells` list (R30) is not made
 * (`cells` is null, as over the guard) and the answer says it was read in
 * pieces (`piecewise`). Over the streamed ceiling the text is refused as a
 * STATED text-undetermined carrying the guard's marker, its size and
 * `final: true`; the container and metadata treatment still runs in full —
 * links from rels (their cell joins honestly undetermined), hidden SHEETS
 * still flagged from the small workbook.xml. Every part read passes
 * ooxml.mjs's part cap (R12, F18).
 *
 * HELD CELLS (G41; K4636, K4639, K4642). A sheet's typed cells are not all made
 * at intake. A caller that passes `{inlineCellsMax}` to text() (reading-pipeline,
 * which stores the reading) gets a sheet's `cells` only while the workbook's
 * cells together, as JSON, are within that many bytes; past it every walked
 * sheet carries `cells: null` and `cells_held: true`, and the cells of a range
 * are made from the held bytes by `cellsIn()`, the same cells the whole read
 * makes, one run of rows at a time. A caller that passes no option is answered
 * as it always was. A workbook under the bound above is read whole, the cells held
 * too: measured (job record, G41), an opted-in read of 19.6 MiB of declared
 * text survives at 48 MB of old space over an idle of 17, inside the 79 MB less
 * the file's size the plane's object leaves, so no smaller threshold for reading
 * in windows is needed (windows cost more for long strings than they save).
 *
 * ACTIVE CONTENT (R32): `active` on structure() and text(), from docx.mjs's
 * one `activeContent` builder, Excel 4.0 macro sheets included; .xlsm/.xltm/
 * .xlam read as this entry with `variant` set (R33).
 *
 * This module asserts nothing about MEANING (FRAMEWORK's, through I2) and
 * WRITES nothing.

 * COFF-11 / IC-100 / D-359 — A SHEET'S BOUND, AND THE DECISION IT CARRIES.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 *
 * THE BOUND IS THE GRID, NEVER THE USED RANGE, and that is a decision rather
 * than a convenience. the sheet walk can say exactly how far this workbook's
 * cells reach, and feeding THAT to the `sheet-cell` arm of C-45.1 would refuse
 * `Summary!D500` on a sheet filled to row 12 — a cell that EXISTS in the
 * workbook and was EMPTY at capture. That is the record refusing a TRUE
 * statement, and in this product an empty cell is routinely the finding
 * ("the disclosure's Schedule B was left blank"). Worse, the refusal does not
 * stop a member citing the document: it pushes them up to the WHOLE DOCUMENT,
 * which claims MORE and not less — the reason already ruled twice in this
 * plane, at the store's `#pageSetForCapture` and `#containerExtentForCapture`.
 * So the bound refuses only the IMPOSSIBLE, and `NoSuchSheet!ZZ9999999` — the
 * address D-354 and D-359 both cite as the measured cost of the unfed arm — is
 * impossible on its ROW and is refused here.
 *
 * THE USED RANGE IS STILL EMITTED, BESIDE IT AND UNDER ITS OWN NAME
 * (`usedRows`/`usedCols`), because the two facts are different and a later
 * reader must be able to tell "empty at capture" from "outside the grid"
 * without either figure pretending to be the other. Nothing consumes the used
 * range today; it is emitted because this walk is the only place that knows it

 * `typedCell`, shared strings from the one list, hidden rows and columns not
 * left out), in row then column order. A call answers at most `maxCells`
 * (default CELLS_IN_MAX) cells and whole rows only: the row that would pass it
 * is left to the next call, `next_row` its number, and `rows.to` the last row
 * answered; the first row is answered whole even if alone it is over. `next_row`
 * is absent when the range was answered whole.
 *
 * (Fix round 9, G131e; S-20) A sheet over a block (1 MiB of text) is read through its ACCESS POINTS: the read that
 * walked it (text() with the caller's cap, else the first point read on this reading) left, for each block of whole rows,
 * where it is and the rows it holds, so a call parses only the blocks that hold the rows asked for and stops when the
 * answer is full, and never inflates or checks the sheet again. `served` is what the call parsed, `{bytes, blocks}`:
 * bounded by the rows asked for and a block, not by the sheet's size or the row's offset. A sheet that cannot be read to
 * its end gives `{ ok:false, reason }`. A cell with no readable column is in every column range. Never throws.
