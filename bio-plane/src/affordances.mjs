/* REC-19: the act catalogue behind op=affordances — what may be DONE to an
 * object, published by the plane (D-139, standing doctrine DEC-8).
 *
 * DEC-8, restated because every act surface builds on this file: the act
 * pre-flight is PLANE-SOURCED always. A surface may render a refusal it
 * received and may never compute one. Publication (op=affordances) is the
 * default; the dry run for the one act whose refusal turns on state a surface
 * cannot see — publication — is `case-authoring`'s op=publishpreflight (its R34,
 * N364), a read and never an act here (NON_ACTS.publishpreflight).
 * No act surface exists before this op, so what this file publishes is the
 * whole of what a surface may know about "what can I do here".
 *
 * WHAT IS DERIVED AND FROM WHERE. An act appears for a target if and only if
 * the plane's own data says the act's op would accept that object as it stands:
 *
 *   - the STATE MACHINE comes from the catalogue's exported STATES table,
 *     imported and never copied (the op=dispose hazard, not repeated);
 *   - the LIVE-CITES facts come from the store's own #citesInto predicate —
 *     the SAME one retire's CITED guard runs, extracted so the publication and
 *     the refusal cannot disagree (an equality that costs nothing is not
 *     evidence; a shared predicate costs the truth);
 *   - `needs` and `mode` are composed at the control plane from NEEDS and
 *     SESSION_OPS, the tables that actually gate the call;
 *   - `weight` is the set-application weight each acting module hard-codes
 *     (the legacy store's selectionResolve doctrine, now record-core's
 *     selection and `perItem`): declared here and CROSS-CHECKED by the suite
 *     against the weight the acting op itself reports.
 *
 * `rung` IS THE INTERACTION-CONSTRUCTS WEIGHT LADDER, AND FW-14 HAS ASSIGNED IT.
 * The ladder is `op-grades'` `RUNG_LADDER` (its R1) — reversible / reasoned / terminal /
 * attested / IRREVERSIBLE, top rung per DEC-19 as amended, with the correction
 * path published beside it. Every op the control plane declares mutating either
 * carries a rung in `RUNGS` or is named in `RUNG_ABSENT` with the ground on which
 * it has none, and `unaccounted(opTable)` (R12) answers that TOTAL IN BOTH
 * DIRECTIONS over the control plane's table of ops.
 *
 * FW-14 (2026-08-08) superseded REC-19's refusal to assign rungs: a rung is derived from what the code enforces,
 * and a rung with no backing is still forbidden.
 *
 * TOTALITY, AND THE DRIFT GUARD. Every op in the control plane's NEEDS table is
 * either an ACT here or named in NON_ACTS with the reason it is not
 * object-directed. `unaccounted(opTable)` below (R12) answers, NAMING the op,
 * any that is in neither set; a caller holding the control plane's tables asks
 * it, so an op added to NEEDS cannot ship unpublished and unexplained.
 *
 * SCOPE. The acts published are the OBJECT-DIRECTED ones: the ops whose subject
 * is a bundle in a given state — the selection-backed set the S-10/S-11 ladder
 * built. Ops that act on captures, entities, tasks, members, selections or the
 * roster are NON_ACTS with their reasons; several are real acts on OTHER kinds
 * of objects and later items fold them in (REC-15 the publication pre-flight).
 *
 * REC-24 (2026-08-05): an `action` publishes `actionmove` and `actioncorrespond`, derived from the same imported
 * state table.

 * ONE array for the same reason DISPOSITIONS is — the store's refusal and the
 * published act must not be able to disagree about what "reopenable" means.
 *
 * WHY `published` BELONGS HERE AND `concluded` DOES NOT, which is the whole of
 * the distinction and is not a softening of REC-31's rule. That rule refuses
 * reverting a finding WITH NO EDITION RECORDED: a concluded inquiry quietly
 * returning to open still wearing its conclusion leaves nothing behind saying
 * the group changed its mind, which is why `concluded` is refused BY NAME and
 * the edition machinery is where that move belongs. A PUBLISHED case has the
 * opposite property. Its editions are ratified, signed and immutable, and
 * DEC-12 is explicit that reopening does not unpublish: every edition keeps
 * answering with its own signature, attestor, time and gate version. So the
 * hazard the exclusion guards against cannot arise on this edge — there is
 * nothing to erase — while the need is real, because published -> open is the
 * ONLY route to a second edition and an act the catalog permits that no caller
 * can perform is the state machine lying.
 *
 * ONE reopen act, not two: "pick this question back up" is one verb, and a
 * second control meaning the same thing on a different state is exactly the
 * drift this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * ===== CASE-4 / DEC-72, 2026-09-10: `published` LEAVES THIS ARRAY AND THE RULE
 * IT STOOD FOR DOES NOT. Every word of the reasoning above is still true; what
 * is no longer true is that a case-member finding WEARS A STATE. DEC-72 ends the
 * `published` lifecycle state and makes publication THE CASE RELATION, so a
 * published finding now sits at `concluded` — the exact state this array refuses
 * BY NAME. Left alone, that is not a conservative outcome: it would refuse
 * reopening to every published case in the record and leave `op=publish`'s
 * second edition, which DEC-12 requires, with no route to it.
 *
 * So the test in `reopen()` is now a DISJUNCTION and this array is only half of
 * it: reopenable FROM A DISPOSITION (this array, unchanged in meaning), OR
 * BECAUSE THE DOCUMENT IS A CASE MEMBER (the store's own case-relation
 * predicate, which cannot live in this file because it is a query). The
 * `concluded` exclusion is thereby PRESERVED EXACTLY WHERE IT WAS AIMED: a
 * concluded finding that was never published is still refused BY NAME with
 * REC-31's own reason, and only the case relation lifts it. Making the whole of
 * `concluded` reopenable would have been the softening this comment warns
 * against, and it is the over-strictness arm CASE-4's control runs.
 *
 * The array stays exported and stays the refusal's `reopenable:` payload,
 * because it is still the answer to "which states does reopening pick a question
 * up from" — the case relation is not a state and does not belong in it.

 * ONE requirement instead of a timing rule: *"the prompt's wording must state
 * the disclosure — that the other question stays on the record and the
 * published child will name it — so what is offered is visibly honesty, not
 * concealment."* The hazard it answers is real and specific: division's visible
 * effect is a HIGHER publishable strength, so a surface offering it beside a
 * weak leg is a surface proposing an act that makes the member's case look
 * stronger, and that is only legitimate because nothing leaves the record.
 *
 * IT LIVES HERE, not in a surface, for DEC-8's reason exactly: a surface
 * renders what it RECEIVED. A prompt that stated the disclosure in one client
 * and not in another would be the forbidden surface-side map, one layer up from
 * the act list this file already publishes. Published on the act, so every
 * surface that can offer the act has the wording that must accompany it, and
 * the suite asserts the string.
 *
 * WHAT IT MUST SAY, and each clause is load-bearing: that NOTHING IS DROPPED
 * (every leg gets a home, including one that cuts against you — the apportionment
 * refuses to lose a leg, which is why division cannot do severance's work at a
 * discount); that THE OTHER QUESTION STAYS ON THE RECORD; and that A PUBLISHED
 * CHILD NAMES ITS PARENT AND ITS SIBLINGS to its readers. */

  + "when a child is published it names them to its readers. If you mean to drop material rather than "
  + "re-home it, sever it with a reason instead.";

/* REC-45 / DEC-29(b), on REC-16's mechanism exactly: THE GROUPING PROMPT.
 *
 * WHY THIS ACT WARRANTS ONE AT ALL, and the argument is DIVIDE_PROMPT's with
 * the hazard one notch sharper. Division's prompt exists because division's
 * visible effect is a HIGHER publishable strength, so a surface offering it is
 * proposing an act that makes the member's case look stronger. Grouping is the
 * SAME shape and more direct: OR takes the MAXIMUM, so this is the one act in
 * the record that raises a finding's grade without adding a single new piece of
 * evidence. DEC-32 names the hazard in those words — *"a member has a standing
 * incentive to bundle a weak ground beside a strong one and publish at the
 * strong one's grade"* — and names the three things that contain it: the
 * assertion is AUTHORED and carries a name, the compound falsifier is the
 * check, and each group's legs stay VISIBLE so a reader tests sufficiency
 * rather than taking it. Two of those three are mechanism this plane enforces,
 * and they are what this wording states.
 *
 * IT LIVES HERE for DEC-8's reason, unchanged from DIVIDE_PROMPT: a surface
 * renders what it RECEIVED and never composes a prompt of its own, so a
 * sentence that appeared in one client and not another would be the forbidden
 * surface-side map one layer up from the act list.
 *
 * EVERY CLAUSE IS MECHANISM, and that is a deliberate boundary rather than a
 * stylistic one. Each sentence below is a fact about what this plane DOES,
 * checkable against code and asserted clause by clause in the suite: (1) what
 * the field means, in the words checkGrounds' own refusal already uses; (2) the
 * MAX composition in `#axisResult`; (3) the server stamp and its carry-forward
 * rule in `groundInquiry`; (4) the branches surviving redaction and being
 * frozen into signed bytes (`published_strength_grounds` in a member published
 * before BIO_Publication_v0_1.md §3 rule 12, `case_strength_grounds` in the case
 * document since — D-442 — required by C-2.8 either way; the prompt's "a
 * published case carries each group … inside the signed bytes" is true of both);
 * (5) the AND default. NOTHING here states a doctrine the record does
 * not already enforce — REC-45 was scoped to report such a sentence as a DEC
 * candidate rather than write one, and one was reported rather than written
 * (DEC-32's operational test, *"would refuting this alone change the
 * conclusion?"*, which belongs to UI-27's elicitation and not to this act).
 *
 * AND IT CARRIES NO ANALYST VOCABULARY, which is DEC-32 clause 1 and is binding
 * on any member-facing string: no AND, no OR, no disjunction, no branch, and
 * not the word `ground` itself — including in this act's own label. The wire
 * name is `inquiryground` because a wire name is not a surface; the sentence a
 * member reads says GROUP. */
export const GROUND_PROMPT =
  "Grouping says these reasons are enough on their own to carry your answer. Your answer's strength is "
  + "then taken from the strongest group rather than from its weakest single reason, so your name and the "

  + "every reason stays visible under the group you put it in, and a published case carries each group and "

  + "their own. Leaving the reasons ungrouped is always available, and is read as no stronger than the "
  + "weakest one.";

/* REC-43 / DEC-39, on REC-16's mechanism exactly: THE CO-ATTESTATION HONESTY
 * FENCE. Third prompt, and the first whose WORDS ARE NOT THIS FILE'S.
 *
 * THE SENTENCE IS BOB'S AND IS TAKEN VERBATIM from the DEC-39 entry. It is not
 * paraphrased, not tightened, and not improved, and that is a rule about this
 * string rather than a courtesy: DEC-39 rules that the fence states GRADE
 * DOCTRINE — what an attestation is worth — so a session rewording it would be
 * a session amending doctrine at a keyboard. If it is wrong, it is amended in
 * DECISIONS.md and this string follows; the drift guards below are built so
 * that a change made HERE and nowhere else is visible rather than silent.
 *
 * THE ONE STRUCTURAL ACCOMMODATION, stated rather than smoothed away. DEC-39
 * renders the wording as a markdown blockquote: three parts, each opened by a
 * bold label, with the question in the first part italicised. `prompt` is a
 * plain string in the published act shape (DIVIDE_PROMPT and GROUND_PROMPT are
 * both single prose strings), so the `**`/`*` markers and the blockquote's line
 * breaks — which are the DECISIONS.md file's RENDERING and not part of the
 * sentence — are not carried. Every WORD, its order, its punctuation and its
 * capitalisation (`TRUE`) are unchanged, and the deliberate three-part shape
 * survives in the three labels the ruling itself wrote. Nothing was added.
 *
 * WHAT THE RULING CORRECTS, because it is the reason the sentence exists and a
 * later reader must not trim it back to the old one. The surface's wording said
 * what co-attestation DOES ("raises Grade B toward evidentiary weight") and what
 * it CANNOT do ("never reaches Grade A") and never said WHAT QUESTION IT
 * ANSWERS — so a reader reaches for it to solve a DIRECTNESS problem it has
 * nothing to do with. Bob's own trial example was a coroner's courtroom
 * testimony held only as a newspaper account: it READ like the co-attestation
 * case and is not one. The first part is what the old sentence omitted, the
 * second is that misreading, the third is the existing fence unchanged.
 *
 * IT LIVES HERE for DEC-8's reason, unchanged from the two prompts above: a
 * surface renders what it RECEIVED and never composes a prompt of its own. The
 * surface authored this sentence until this item (`ATTEST_YIELDS_GRADE` in
 * civicos-ui/app.html), which DEC-39 calls the last member-facing claim about
 * the record's semantics that the record did not own; UI-28 renders the
 * publication and stops writing one.
 *
 * AND THE TWO GRADE LETTERS ARE COMPOSED FROM THE RULE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE
 * POINT OF THE ITEM. `Grade B` and `Grade A` are not typed here: the ceiling is
 * `EARNED_CAPTURE_CEILING`, imported from `record-grammar`, the one definition
 * of the grades that the earned-leg check refuses a leg claiming more than it
 * against, and the unreachable letter is `UNREACHABLE_CAPTURE_GRADE`, the rank
 * of `BASIS_GRADES` immediately above it, defined beside it. So the
 * published sentence is a FUNCTION of the enforced rule rather than a copy that
 * happens to agree with it today — REC-35's finding restated on a sentence
 * instead of an array, and an identical copy would agree at zero cost, which is
 * why the affordances suite's drift guard is STRUCTURAL as well as behavioural.
 *
 * IT REFUSES TO COMPOSE A SENTENCE IT CANNOT MAKE TRUE. If the ceiling were
 * ever raised to the strongest grade there would be no unreachable letter, and
 * "it never reaches Grade null" is worse than no fence at all. That is a load
 * failure, not a fallback: the module fails to evaluate and the whole plane
 * fails to start, which is the only honest outcome for a doctrine string whose
 * doctrine has moved out from under it. */

/* REC-38, UI-22's delegation: THE CAPTURE-DIRECTED ACTS' METADATA, and the
 * SHAPE IS THE WHOLE OF THIS ITEM'S DECISION — stated here rather than in a
 * commit message, because the next session will meet the same fork.
 *
 * THE FORK. `attest` was the last act in this plane whose member-facing label
 * was written by a surface: op=affordances published nothing for it, so
 * civicos-ui spelled "Co-attest this capture" itself (UI-22 raised it rather
 * than papering over it). Two ways to fix that. Promote `attest` into ACTS with
 * an applies(), or publish a SEPARATE block for the capture-directed class.
 *
 * PROMOTING IT INTO `ACTS` WAS REJECTED, and not on taste — it would have been
 * DISHONEST in the precise way this file exists to prevent:
 *
 *   (1) THE SUBJECT IS WRONG. Every entry in ACTS is an act on A BUNDLE IN A
 *       GIVEN STATE; that is what the header says and what `deriveActs` is. The
 *       subject of op=attest is a CAPTURE SHA. A capture is not in a state, has
 *       no edges, and can be held by several bundles or by none.
 *   (2) THE DERIVATION HAS NOTHING TO DERIVE FROM. `applies()` is handed
 *       affordanceFacts — object_type, current_state, cites edges,
 *       basis legs. No capture sha is in that shape and no bucket is reachable
 *       from it. The only applies() writable over those facts is
 *       `ty === "information"`, which is NOT what op=attest gates on: it gates
 *       on evidence storage being configured (503), the sha being 64 hex
 *       (BAD_SHA) and THE BYTES ACTUALLY BEING IN THE STORE (NO_SUCH_CAPTURE).
 *       So an information bundle holding no capture would publish the act and
 *       the op would refuse it — a pre-flight disagreeing with the refusal it
 *       fronts, DEC-8's headline failure, arrived at by way of fixing a label.
 *   (3) IT WOULD SPLIT A CLASS. `monitor` is capture-directed for the same
 *       reason and would have stayed behind in NON_ACTS, so the two halves of
 *       one doctrine would sit in two registries with no rule relating them.
 *
 * WHAT IS PUBLISHED INSTEAD, and why it costs nothing to be honest: a block
 * beside `vocabularies` carrying id and LABEL for each capture-directed op —
 * and NOTHING ELSE, because everything else already has a home. `needs`, `mode`
 * and `rung` are composed at the control plane by `decorateAct`, the SAME
 * function every act in ACTS goes through, reading NEEDS, SESSION_OPS and RUNGS
 * — the tables that actually gate the call. That is what makes `RUNGS.attest`
 * reachable: it has been correct and unpublished since REC-19 only because
 * decorateAct ran over ACTS alone.
 *
 * SO THE LABEL IS THE ONLY NEW FACT, and it lives here for DISPOSITIONS' reason
 * exactly — one array, no copy. A surface renders it; a surface does not write
 * it.
 *
 * THESE STAY IN `NON_ACTS`. They are not object-directed acts and publishing
 * their metadata does not make them ones; the totality guard over NEEDS is
 * unchanged. What the suite adds is the OTHER totality — every NON_ACT whose
 * reason begins `capture-directed:` appears here, and nothing else does — so a
 * third capture-directed op cannot ship with no label either.
 *
 * A PROMPT NOW, AND THE PARAGRAPH THIS REPLACES WAS RIGHT WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN.
 * CORRECTED 2026-08-04 by REC-43 / DEC-39, stated rather than quietly reworded
 * because the reasoning it recorded is the reasoning that produced the ruling.
 * REC-38 wrote here that `attest` carries NO PROMPT deliberately — that the
 * co-attestation honesty fence was "a real candidate for DEC-29(b)'s `prompt`
 * treatment" but was NOT invented here, because no ruling attached it to the
 * act, the surface's own sentence is not a source, and guessing at one is what
 * RUNGS (`op-grades`) refuses. That refusal was correct and it is what routed
 * the question to Bob. DEC-39 answered it — PUBLISH IT, AND IT MUST STATE THE
 * QUESTION CO-ATTESTATION ANSWERS — so the act now carries `ATTEST_FENCE`, whose
 * words are Bob's and whose two grade letters are the enforced rule's. Nothing
 * about the RUNGS reasoning changes: `rung` here is still the sourced
 * `attested` and no rung is guessed anywhere in this file. */

     corrected rather than deleted. It read: "NO RUNG: no document assigns one …
     inventing 'reasoned' here because it feels reasoned is exactly the guessing
     this file refuses." That refusal was correct — REC-19 had no licence to
     assign — and the rung is NOT assigned now because it feels reasoned. It is
     assigned because the store REFUSES the act NO_CONCLUSION and NO_FALSIFIER
     without an authored account, which is Constructs:161's definition of the
     rung enforced in code. The suite asserts that backing. The entry requirements (a conclusion, a falsifier, at least
     one basis leg) and the named-member rule are ACT-TIME refusals the store
     words itself, the release precedent: publishing the act says the state
     machine permits the move, not that this caller's parameters will pass.
     CORRECTED 2026-09-17 (REC-117), AND THE RUNG SURVIVES THE CHANGE THAT
     BROKE THE SENTENCE. Bob ruled NO_FALSIFIER overridable, so `store.conclude`
     no longer refuses it unconditionally: a member may conclude with no
     falsifier by DECLARING the absence, which the record then carries in their
     name and with a date. The sentence above is left standing because it is
     still true of NO_CONCLUSION — which is refused unconditionally and has no
     override — and REC-76's finding is what makes that enough: the rung is
     graded by the FAMILY (`op-grades`' JUSTIFICATION_REFUSALS, its R1) and
     never by one spelling, so an act that still demands an authored account for
     WHAT was concluded is still `reasoned`. What the override changes is the
     ACCOUNT the member must give, never whether one is required: stating that
     no falsifier can honestly be given IS the authored account, and it is
     attributed. The one thing that would drop this rung is an override the
     plane could take SILENTLY, and that is the case C-2.8 and the store both
     refuse by name.
     REC-142 / INVESTIGATIVE-SESSION.md §7.1 item 8 — THE PROJECT ARM, and it is the store's own
     condition read from the other side. `store.conclude` accepts a PROJECT's conclusion on a
     question whose OWN state already reads `concluded` (REC-124: that state is the no-project
     relationship's, and one relationship's conclusion must not bar another's), but the edge table
     has no `concluded -> concluded` edge, so keyed on it alone the act the store accepts was never
     published there — the surface renders only what the plane publishes (DEC-8), and §7.1 item 8
     was honoured by the store and unreachable by a member (UI-65's DELEGATION).
     ONE ACT, NOT A SECOND ID (decided on REC-142's claim): the relationship is `project=`, the
     act's PARAMETER, as `withdrawconclusion` and `versioncurrent` leave WHICH project to theirs.
     `concludes_for_project` is the positional fact (D-310's shape) — the caller has JOINED some
     project it can see that live-cites the question — so a stranger, an invited member who never
     joined, an administrator who sees every project and joined none, and a machine credential
     (null) are not offered what the store would refuse them for every `project=` they could name.
     NO EDGE IS ADDED, AND THAT IS THE LIAR THIS REFUSES: a `concluded -> concluded` edge would
     publish the act to everybody and let the NO-PROJECT relationship conclude twice, re-opening a
     conclusion to itself. `conclude-project-arm.test.mjs` asserts both, through the op. */

     means, the same one op=dispose writes INTO — and the catalog's edge table
     offers `open` from there. There is NO SECOND EDGE SOURCE and no state
     list local to this file; a legacy focus/problem document is excluded by
     the table itself, because its own vocabulary spells its open state
     `surfaced` and has no `open` edge at all.
     WHY THE DISPOSITION SET AND NOT THE WHOLE EDGE TABLE: `concluded -> open`
     is ALSO legal (REC-13 added it — a conclusion is revisable), and it is
     NOT this act. DEC-12 makes reopening a conclusion an EDITION, and REC-14
     builds that machinery; publishing `reopen` on a concluded inquiry would
     put a control on the strip that reverts a published finding with no
     edition recorded, which is the DEC-8 disagreement in the worse direction
     — a publication the store then has to refuse. The store refuses it by
     name (NOT_SET_DOWN) and this list does not offer it. Weight `single`: one
     question is picked back up at a time. RUNG `reasoned` (FW-14) — the line
     this replaces said "rung null for conclude's reasons … no document assigns
     this act a rung", which was true of REC-19 and is superseded by the same
     derivation conclude's is: the store refuses NO_REASON, so an authored
     account is REQUIRED and the rung is that requirement stated.
     EXTENDED AT THE REC-14 MERGE, and the exclusion above is UNCHANGED: the
     FROM set is REOPENABLE_FROM, which adds `published` and still refuses
     `concluded`. A published case's editions are signed and immutable and
     reopening does not unpublish them (DEC-12), so the "reverts a finding with
     no edition recorded" hazard this act was scoped around cannot arise there
     -- and published -> open is the only route to a second edition. The

     RUNG `irreversible` — THE LADDER'S TOP RUNG, AND THIS IS THE ONE OP THAT
     CARRIES IT (DEC-19 as amended, Bob 2026-08-03: *"Publishing IS an
     irreversible act! It's (one of?) the only irreversible acts."*). The
     correction path travels with it and is published as
     `vocabularies.rung_correction_path`, never instead of the rung: a further
     edition is a separate document and every published edition stands, a
     withdrawal is another attested act and both stand, and a finding can be
     rescinded to an inquiry by removing its claim. Nothing is erased.

     THE PARAGRAPH THIS REPLACES WAS RIGHT WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND IS KEPT IN
     SUBSTANCE, because its distinction is the one that makes this rung correct
     rather than lucky. It read: "publishing feels like the most `attested` act
     in the system, and `ratify` IS assigned that rung by Constructs:275. But
     this act is not the attestation — it AUTHORS the bytes that are then
     attested … Inventing 'attested' here because it sits next to ratify is
     exactly the guessing this file refuses." That is still true, and it is why
     `publish` is NOT `attested`: it is a rung ABOVE, on a ruling that names it,
     not a rung borrowed from its neighbour.

     The entry requirements (the completeness statement, the exclusion FIELD,
     the declared and justified subject position) and C-21.1's freshness check
     are ACT-TIME refusals the store words itself — the release precedent:
     publishing the act says the state machine permits the move, not that this
     caller's parameters will pass.

     `!f.case_member` IS THE OTHER HALF AND IT IS NOT NEW BEHAVIOUR. Before
     CASE-4 a member of a published case wore `current_state: published`, whose
     edge list carried no `published` destination, so the act was already not
     offered there — and `op=publish` would already have refused it, since
     publishing an unchanged member would mint a second edition of bytes nobody
     revised. The condition is now said instead of falling out of the table. A
     member that HAS been revised (reopened, worked, concluded again) is no
     longer pinned, so `case_member` is false and the act reappears — which is
     exactly DEC-12's second-edition route.

     CASE-4 / DEC-72, 2026-09-10: `edgesFrom(f).includes("published")` WAS THE
     PRECONDITION WEARING A STATE MACHINE'S CLOTHES, and it is now the
     precondition itself. There is no `published` destination in the inquiry
     machine any more, so that expression is FALSE FOR EVERY DOCUMENT — the act
     would have vanished from every affordance answer with the suite green,
     which is the failure mode a state removal produces if nobody looks. The
     condition was only ever true from `concluded` (it was `concluded`'s edge and
     no other state's), so `concluded` IS the expression, said plainly. This is
     the affordance-layer half of the same sentence `publishCase()`'s
     NOT_CONCLUDED refusal carries, and the two must agree: an act this file
     offers that the store then refuses is the pre-flight lying, which is the one
     thing affordances.mjs exists to prevent.

     D-310, 2026-09-10: `f.project_owner !== false` IS THE FOURTH CONDITION, AND
     IT IS THE ONE THIS ACT WAS MISSING RATHER THAN A NEW RULE. DEC-72 clause 5
     — *"Only a project OWNER publishes"* — has been enforced in `publishCase()`
     since CASE-2, which refuses a non-owner BY NAME (`NOT_THE_PROJECT_OWNER`).
     This predicate had no condition on who is asking, so a member who owns no
     project was offered publication on every concluded finding and would be
     refused at the act: the DEC-8 disagreement this file's header calls the one
     thing it exists to prevent, on the heaviest act in the system. CASE-6 found
     it while reading the op path the publication surface calls, and deliberately
     did not half-fix it inside a surfaces item.
     `!== false` AND NOT `=== true`, WHICH IS THE WHOLE OF THE SHAPE. The fact is
     three-valued and the third value is STATED: a machine-class credential holds
     no roster position, so the store answers `null` rather than `false`, and a
     null does not narrow. A machine credential's published act set is therefore
     unchanged by this clause — it is refused publication by a different rule at a
     different level (`MACHINE_CANNOT_PUBLISH`, DEC-49's fence, first in
     `publishCase()`), and a gate that quietly absorbed that second rule would be
     a fence tighter than its rule. Undetermined is first-class here as everywhere.
     AND IT IS "OWNER OF SOME PROJECT", deliberately. The project is a PARAMETER
     of `op=publish`; this file is asked about an INQUIRY and cannot know which
     project a caller will name, so the act says what every act here says — the
     record permits the move, not that this caller's parameters will pass — while
     no longer saying it to somebody for whom NO parameter could succeed. The
     per-pair question (may this viewer publish for THIS project) is a different
     fact and a different item, D-311, recorded at NON_ACTS' participation block.
     D-311, 2026-09-23: A MACHINE IS NOW WITHHELD `publish`, AND NOT BY THIS CLAUSE. The null above
     still does not narrow here; `deriveActs` withholds every act in `MACHINE_REFUSALS` from a caller
     the store states `actor_is_machine`, because `publishCase()` refuses that class BY NAME
     (MACHINE_CANNOT_PUBLISH) whatever its position. Two rules, two places — which is what this
     paragraph asked for — and the machine's is now published instead of discovered at the act. */
  /* REC-135 / INVESTIGATIVE-SESSION.md §7.1 item 4, 2026-09-19: `concluded` IS
     ASKED OF A RELATIONSHIP, SO THE STATE WORD IS NO LONGER THE WHOLE OF IT.
     `op=conclude&project=` writes the project's adoption onto the PROJECT and
     deliberately leaves the shared question's own state where it was (§7: one
     team's decision never moves another's). So a member whose team HAS concluded
     a shared question sees `current_state: open` on it, and this predicate — the
     affordance-layer half of publishCase()'s NOT_CONCLUDED sentence, which the
     paragraph above says the two must AGREE on — would have gone on hiding the
     act from exactly the member item 4 exists for.
     A DISJUNCTION AND NOT A REPLACEMENT, because both relationships publish: the
     no-project conclusion in a question's own bytes still admits a case (item 5
     reads it as the no-project relationship's and the case document now SAYS so),
     and `concluded_for_project` adds the project's own. `=== true` is the whole

     half of publishCase()'s ALREADY_A_CASE_MEMBER, and that refusal now asks the
     RELATIONSHIP too: a finding a case pins at its current bytes may still take a
     new edition when a joined project's conclusion has moved since every edition
     pinning those bytes (a withdrawal, then a conclusion on another reading, never
     moves the finding's bytes). Without this disjunct the store would accept that
     edition and the surface would never offer it — REC-142's defect shape, the
     route reachable by the raw op and by no member (Q12/DEC-8).
     A DISJUNCTION AND NOT A REPLACEMENT, REC-135's reason: `!f.case_member` still
     offers every finding no case pins, and `edition_warranted_for_project` is asked
     only of the ones a case does. `=== true` is the whole of the three-valued
     handling, as above: a null never widens. `case_member` itself is unchanged and

     precisely the DEC-8 disagreement: a pre-flight offering a control the
     refusal it fronts would then decline. ONE leg IS enough, and deliberately:
     two different questions may rest on the same document, and R4 permits a leg
     to land on one child or on BOTH.

     IT IS STILL THE RIGHT ANALYSIS AND IT DECIDED THE RUNG: "it is tempting to
     write `terminal` here because the parent never moves again — but the parent
     is corrected FORWARD into its children rather than ended, which is not what
     the ladder's `terminal` says." `terminal` is reserved for a state with no
     outgoing edge (op=retire alone); forward correction is not terminality, and
     that distinction is exactly why this act sits at `reasoned` and not above
     it.

     WHY THE LEG COUNT IS PART OF THE DERIVATION and not a detail, exactly as it
     is for division above: a partition is a partition OF THE LEGS, so a
     question resting on nothing has nothing to group and the store refuses it
     NO_BASIS. Publishing the act there would be a pre-flight offering a control
     the refusal it fronts would decline, which is the DEC-8 disagreement this
     file exists to prevent. ONE leg IS enough and deliberately so: a member may
     legitimately say that the single thing they have is enough on its own, and
     the act is also the only route BACK to an ungrouped basis.

     THE TWO STATES IT IS NOT OFFERED IN, and the store refuses each BY NAME so
     a caller that arrives anyway is told which rule it met.  `published`: the
     composed pair and the per-group breakdown are inside signed, ratified bytes
     (REC-14/REC-42), and re-partitioning underneath them would change what the
     document's own basis composes to while an edition on the record says
     otherwise — DEC-12's route is reopen, restructure, republish, which is the
     same shape PUBLISHED_CANNOT_DIVIDE takes one act over.  `divided`: the
     parent has been declared MALFORMED and carried forward into children that
     supersede it (REC-16), and re-deriving a terminal parent's strength after
     the fact would move a number its children's disclosure already pointed at.

     RUNG `reasoned` (FW-14). The line this replaces said "it is tempting to
     write `reasoned` here; that is the guessing this file refuses" — and the
     temptation is no longer what decides it: `groundInquiry` refuses NO_REASON,
     so an authored account is REQUIRED by the store and the rung is that
     enforcement stated rather than a feeling about the act's weight.

     WEIGHT `single`, conclude's precedent: one question's structure is authored
     at a time, and a bulk version would be the checkbox these constructs exist
     to refuse — the more so here, because this is the act that RAISES a grade.

     THE PROMPT RIDES THE ACT (DEC-29(b), REC-16's mechanism): every surface
     that can offer grouping receives the wording that must accompany it. The
     reasoning for why this act warrants one, and for the vocabulary bound every
     clause of it respects, is on GROUND_PROMPT itself.

     NOT_CITABLE, and this entry publishes exactly that and no narrower rule.

     THE LABEL IS TYPE-NEUTRAL NOW, because one act publishing itself as "in a
     project" on a question would be the publication disagreeing with the op it
     fronts — the disagreement this file exists to prevent.

     REC-72 CHANGES NOTHING IN THIS ENTRY AND THAT IS THE POINT, stated so the
     next reader does not go looking for the edit. Widening `op=cite`'s CASE arm
     to admit a question as a MEMBER is a change to which sets the op accepts,
     not to which objects publish the act: an inquiry already published `cite`
     (as a citing object since REC-37, and as a member of somebody else's
     selection all along), and this row was already as wide as the op. What
     REC-72 did move is `sever`/`reinstate` below, because those two were
     NARROWER than the op they front. */

     Under REC-19's rule — a rung comes from a DOCUMENT — that was correct.
     FW-14's rule is that a rung comes from what the code ENFORCES, and under it
     "a reason is required" is not a temptation, it is the evidence: the store
     refuses NO_REASON, and Constructs:161 defines `reasoned` as exactly that

  /* PL-2 / IS-2 — THE SIX MEMBER OPS OF THE SIXTH STATE MACHINE.
   *
   * WHY THEY ARE `ACTS` AND NOT `NON_ACTS`, decided rather than assumed, and the
   * paragraph the IS-6 lander wrote above about `airunopen` predicted exactly
   * this: *"what a run eventually proposes IS an act on an object, and it is
   * IS-1's and IS-2's; that act will be an ACTS row, and this one is not it."*
   * The subject of these six is an inquiry's own basis — the question moves in
   * the member's hands when one is taken — which is what an object-directed act
   * is. The three run verbs are not acts because a run *changes NOTHING about*
   * the object it names; these change what the record stands on.
   *
   * THE DERIVATION IS OVER REAL FACTS AND NOT OVER THE TYPE. A question holding
   * no readings publishes none of the six, because the op would refuse
   * NO_SUCH_VERSION and a pre-flight offering a control the refusal it fronts
   * would decline is DEC-8's headline failure — the same reason `inquirydivide`
   * counts basis legs and `retire` counts live cites. The fact is
   * `basis_version_states`, which `affordanceFacts` (./affordances/facts.mjs) reads from the document; the RULE
   * over it is here, where every other act's rule lives, and `edgesFor` below is
   * the machine's OWN table so this file holds no state list of its own. Grep
   * it: no version-state word appears in any of the six entries.
   *
   * WEIGHT `single` on all six, conclude's precedent: one reading is settled at
   * a time and there is no set to apply. A bulk version would be the checkbox
   * these constructs exist to refuse, and the more so here, because this is the
   * family of acts that decides what a case rests on.
   *
   * RUNGS ON THESE SIX ARE NOT ALL THE SAME, AND THAT IS THE POINT (FW-14). The
   * line this replaces said "NO RUNG on any of them. It is tempting to write
   * `reasoned` on reject and consider because both REQUIRE a reason, and that is
   * exactly the guess RUNGS refuses." The observation was exactly right and is
   * now the derivation: `versionreject` and `versionconsider` ARE `reasoned`,
   * because `VERSION_REASON_REQUIRED` is `['considering', 'rejected']` and the
   * store enforces it through the ONE predicate `versionNeedsReason`.
   * THE OTHER FOUR ARE NOT, AND A TEXTUAL CLASSIFIER WOULD HAVE GOT THIS WRONG:
   * all six route through the same `#moveVersionState` and the same
   * `VERSION_NO_REASON` refusal, so anything grading these ops by finding that
   * code in the shared helper would have promoted four of them to a rung the
   * store does not enforce. R19's drive therefore performs the acts (this
   * module's tests), never reading the helper's text.
   * `versionrevert` and `versionhide` are `reversible` (revert's target state
   * reaches every state it runs from; hide is its own inverse — `hidden=false`).
   * `versionaccept` and `versioncurrent` are `reversible` since R27's ruling
   * (K211): acceptance is corrected FORWARD, and a published act (reconsider,
   * turn down, stand on another reading) takes its result back.
   *
   * THE ENTRY REQUIREMENTS ARE ACT-TIME REFUSALS the store words itself: which
   * version, the authored reason, the legal edge, the transitive cycle at accept,
   * acceptance before make-current, a project that draws on the question. The

   * not that this caller's parameters will pass. */

     its references carry a confirmed cites edge.

     REC-72 CHANGED BOTH HALVES OF THE CITED SIDE, and each change is a rule.

     (i) A QUESTION IS NOW A CITED SIDE. `op=cite`'s case arm admits an inquiry
         (REC-72), so a case can draw on a question — and a case that could join
         a question and never leave it is a worse shape than one that can do
         neither, because there would then be no recorded way to stop drawing on
         it. The withdrawal is the same act on the same block of the same
         document, so it is offered wherever the edge can exist.

     (ii) THE FACT IS `cited_by_case` AND NOT `cites_in`, WHICH FIXES A LATENT
          DEC-8 DISAGREEMENT REC-37 LEFT. `#edgeTransition` — the one helper
          behind both these acts — refuses a citing object that is not a project
          (`NOT_A_PROJECT`). `cites_in` counts EVERY citer, and since REC-37 a
          QUESTION also writes `rel: cites` into its own references when it
          takes a basis leg. So an Information cited only by a question published
          `sever` on a target where the op would have refused. Nothing was
          looking for it: every suite's citer was a project. Withdrawing a basis
          LEG is a real gap and it is a different act — it belongs to the basis
          family (`inquiryground`, the version machine), not to this pair, and it
          is reported as a class finding rather than smuggled in here. */

     is EXPORTED and two suites call it with hand-built facts objects; a fact
     read through a bare `.` threw a TypeError there, `repair-reachability`'s own
     `actsAt` helper SWALLOWED it in a `try/catch` and returned "no acts at any
     state", and its A3 judgement then reported six offenders that do not exist.
     An instrument reporting a wrong number is harder to notice than one
     reporting zero. In the plane the same crash would have taken the whole
     `op=affordances` answer down for every object. Absent reads as ZERO, which
     is the SAFE direction: an act is not published where the fact behind it is

     is not.

     D-444 NARROWS THE PROJECT ARM, which REC-183 left as a stated residue. The two arms ask the
     same question from the two ends of the edge. From the TARGET's end `current_state` answers it
     outright. From the PROJECT's end it cannot be answered by `cites_out.severed` at all: that is a

     `severed_reinstatable`, counted through `#retiredNotCitable`, the predicate `#edgeTransition`
     itself runs; the arm keys on it and the offer cannot drift from the refusal.

     IT IS NARROWED AND NOT DROPPED, which is the whole of the accepts-when: a project holding a
     severed edge onto a LIVE target must still be offered `reinstate`, and the store must still
     accept it. Withholding the act from every project would satisfy "never offer what is refused"

     They sat in NON_ACTS since REC-19 and D-310 decided they STAY there until a per-pair fact
     existed (NON_ACTS' participation block records it). It exists now:
     the store states `f.roster` — the caller's position IN THIS PROJECT, asked of the `by` stamp
     the roster acts themselves receive — and each predicate below is its own act's refusal
     stated as a condition, never D-310's "owner of SOME project":
       projectinvite      NOT_THE_OWNER            (`projectInvite`)   -> owner of THIS project
       projectjoin        NOT_INVITED              (`projectJoin`)     -> a participation row, not
                          `joined` (REC-186: a joined caller's join changes nothing)
       projectleave       NOT_A_PARTICIPANT/NOT_JOINED, LAST_COMMITTED_OWNER (`projectLeave`)
                          -> state `joined`, and an owner only while another owner is committed (R35)
       projectremove      NOT_THE_OWNER            (`projectRemove`)   -> owner of THIS project
       projectowneradd    NOT_THE_OWNER            (`projectOwnerAdd`) -> owner of THIS project
       projectownerremove NOT_THE_OWNER, LAST_OWNER, LAST_COMMITTED_OWNER (`projectOwnerRemove`) ->
                          owner, the one-owner floor clear and some owner committed (a one-owner
                          project, or one whose owners have all asked to leave, refuses EVERY parameter)
       projectownerrescue NOT_AN_ADMIN, NO_OWNERS, OWNERS_ARE_ACTIVE (membership `rescueRefusal`) -> open
     `projectremove` IS AN OWNER'S, NOT AN ADMINISTRATOR'S: Membership Architecture v2 §7.7
     REVERSED v1.4, and the store has refused a non-owner since. D-311's own row and D-310's
     argument both said "an ADMINISTRATOR's" — the v1.4 reading; each predicate here is derived
     from the refusal its op RAISES, which is what caught it.
     `projectjoin` IS OFFERED TO A PARTICIPANT WHO IS NOT JOINED — invited, or leaving (whose join
     withdraws the request, 7.6). CORRECTED by REC-186 on BOB #31's ruling of 2026-09-23 21:37Z: this
     read "offered to every participant, joined ones included … withholding it there would be a fence
     tighter than its rule". `projectJoin` stays idempotent and a joined caller's join still SUCCEEDS,
     but it changes nothing, and an offer that does nothing is an overclaim (DEC-8) — the store is not
     narrowed, only the offer. `projectleave` likewise is not offered to an owner who is the last
     COMMITTED one: `projectLeave` refuses LAST_COMMITTED_OWNER unless another owner has not asked to
     leave (membership R35, REC-224), which `f.roster.other_owner_committed` states (N45).
     WHAT THESE DO NOT SAY is what turns on a PARAMETER — the handle named, its status, the reason,
     the 7.10 votes still owed (CONSENSUS_REQUIRED, VOTES_SHORT) — the release precedent: the
     record permits the move, not that this caller's parameters will pass.
     `=== true` EVERYWHERE, and it is the shape an ADDITION takes: `f.roster` is null when no
     position could be asked (a DO-internal call, a non-project target), and an undetermined
     position must not publish an act. A bearer's `by` is `class:<cls>`, which holds no row, so a
     machine credential is offered none of the seven — each of which its class is refused.

 * capture sha, never on a bundle's state — so an `applies()` over `affordanceFacts` would have nothing to read. What a surface needs from
 * the plane is the WEIGHT (so it knows a selection is one call, not N) and the SET KEY; both are published
 * here, and `op=affordances` serves this table as `set_acts`. The bound, `PER_ITEM_MAX`, is record-core's (its
 * R49, N91), whose `perItem` enforces it, re-exported here unchanged (R6), so the number a surface reads is the
