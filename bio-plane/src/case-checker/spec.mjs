const V1 = `# The case file, format bio-case-file/1

This document specifies version 1 of the case file: the one file (or set of parts) that carries a published case whole, so that anybody can check it and recreate its findings without a copy of Civicsmith. It states every field, kind and rule a checker needs. A checker built from this text alone, given the same case file, answers the same as the checker Civicsmith runs.

Recreating a case shows that what it carries is intact and consistent with what it states. It does not show that the case is true, and it is not an endorsement of it.

## 1. Parts

A case file is one or more parts. Each part is a ZIP archive whose every entry is stored, not compressed, with fixed timestamps (1980-01-01 00:00:00), names in UTF-8, and no encryption. A case file too large for one part (64 MiB) is split into several; nothing is left out for size.

Every part carries the same manifest, byte for byte, as the entry \`manifest.json\` at the archive's root. Every other entry is a file the manifest lists in that part, at its \`path\` from the archive's root. A part carries no entry the manifest does not list.

## 2. The manifest

The manifest is a JSON object with exactly these fields:

- \`format\`: \`bio-case-file/1\`.
- \`group\`: the slug of the group that published the case.
- \`case\`, \`edition\`: the case's id and its edition (a whole number from 1).
- \`case_document_sha\`: the SHA-256 (64 lowercase hex) of the case document's bytes.
- \`keys\`: the signing keys, at least one, each \`{key, fingerprint}\`. \`key\` is an OpenSSH \`ssh-ed25519\` public key on one line; \`fingerprint\` is its OpenSSH fingerprint, \`SHA256:\` followed by the unpadded base64 of the SHA-256 of the key's wire bytes.
- \`parts\`: each part, \`{index, sha256, bytes}\`, numbered from 1 in order. A part's \`sha256\` is the SHA-256 of one line per file of the part, in path order, each \`<path> <sha256> <bytes>\` and a newline (UTF-8), and its \`bytes\` the sum of those files' sizes. (The manifest sits inside every part, so it cannot list a digest of a whole part's archive.)
- \`files\`: every file, in path order, each \`{path, sha256, bytes, part, kind}\`: its path, the SHA-256 and size of its bytes, the part that carries it, and its kind.

## 3. The kinds of file, and their paths

Each kind is carried at one path, so a file's path says which finding or material it belongs to:

- \`case_document\` at \`case.md\`: the signed case document (section 4). Exactly one.
- \`case_signature\` at \`case.md.sig\`: the case document's signature, an armored SSH signature (section 5). Exactly one.
- \`complete_edition\` at \`complete-edition.html\`: the complete edition (section 6). Exactly one.
- \`finding\` at \`findings/<finding>/finding.md\`: one finding's published bytes.
- \`finding_signature\` at \`findings/<finding>/finding.md.sig\`: a member finding's signature.
- \`grading_facts\` at \`findings/<finding>/grading-facts.json\`: one finding's grading facts as recorded at the act, JSON \`{legs}\`. Each leg is \`{target, kind, role, grade, grade_axis, grade_source, ground, target_edition?, answer?, origins?, origins_complete?, captures?, author_key?, undetermined?}\`: \`kind\` is \`document\`, \`observation\`, \`inquiry\` (another finding), \`imported\` (another group's finding), or a leg counted on the capture axis only (\`calculation\`, whose \`target\` names a \`calculations:\` row by its \`calc\`, a held \`standard\`, or an \`occurrence\`); \`undetermined\`, on such a leg, the reason its capture grade is undetermined, or null (a row written before the field reads it null); \`grade_axis\` one of \`capture\`, \`connection\`, \`testimony\`; \`answer\`, for an \`inquiry\` leg, the pair the finding it rests on answered, per axis \`{state, grade}\`; \`captures\` the SHA-256 of each capture a document leg rests on.
- \`passages\` at \`findings/<finding>/passages.json\`: one finding's relied-on passages, a JSON list of \`{content_id, capture_sha, extent, chain, quoted}\`: \`extent\` in the extent grammar's canonical form (section 7), \`chain\` the text chain the passage was read through, or null.
- \`document\` at \`materials/<ref>/document\`: a captured document's bytes, whole.
- \`extracted_text\` at \`materials/<ref>/extracted.txt\`: a document's extracted text, the canonical JSON of its reading's units in order, each \`{extent, ref, text}\`. Its SHA-256 is the material's \`text_sha\`.
- \`observation\` at \`materials/<ref>/observation.md\`: an observation's text, whole.
- \`attestation\` at \`attestations/<ref>/<name>\`: a signed account, a timestamp token or a co-archive record.
- \`calculation\`, at three paths, one kind: \`calculations/<calc>/calculation.json\`, one calculation a member's chain reaches, its \`calculations:\` row (section 4) as canonical JSON, which must be what the signed row states; \`calculations/<calc>/inputs/<sha256>\`, each input the row names, as the canonical JSON the calculation engine evaluates (a table \`{fields, rows}\` or a figure), named by its SHA-256 (the manifest lists it with that SHA-256, or it departs: the input_sha rule); and \`calculations/prov.jsonld\`, once, the calculations rendered as W3C PROV-O in JSON-LD, which must be the rendering of the signed rows.

\`<finding>\` is a finding's id, \`<ref>\` a material's \`ref\` and \`<calc>\` a calculation's \`calc\` (section 4).

## 4. The case document

The case document is text: a front matter between two lines \`---\`, in the record's restricted grammar (top-level keys; a key whose value is a block holds a map or a list of flat maps; scalars are \`null\`, \`true\`, \`false\`, integers, decimals, double- or single-quoted strings, or bare words), then a Markdown body. Its format is \`bio-case-document/7\`, or \`bio-case-document/6\`, which is identical in fields (\`/5\` to \`/1\` are older). The two differ only in the product name the complete edition renders (section 6). A checker reads these fields:

- \`case_id\`, \`case_edition\`, \`case_findings\` (the members), \`case_roles\` (per member \`{target, role, version_sha, edition}\`, \`role\` \`load_bearing\` or \`supporting\`, \`version_sha\` the SHA-256 of the member's published bytes).
- \`case_strength\`: each member's frozen pair, one row per member and axis \`{target, axis, state, grade, …}\`. A case has no strength of its own.
- \`required_strength\`: the bar, \`{declared, capture, connection, …}\`; an axis with a grade is declared.
- \`method:\` \`{grading, checks}\`: the grading method's version and the catalogue version the document was checked under.
- \`materials:\` one row per document or observation any member's chain reaches, \`{ref, kind, sha, text_sha, origin, archived_copy, included, rests_under}\`. \`included\` is true when the material travels whole. Material whose source's identity is withheld is listed like any other.
- \`material_attestations:\` one row per attestation, \`{ref, by_kind, by, level, at, signature, recorded_in}\`. \`by_kind\` is \`member\` (a capturing member's signed account, or an observation's author; at \`group\` or \`project\` level it carries no handle, key or signature), \`co_attestation\` (a trusted timestamp or a co-archive), \`project\` (the project's record holds the material) or \`group\` (\`signature\` is the literal \`case\`: the case document's signature covers it).
- \`capture_accounts:\` each signed account \`{capture, by, at, text_b64, signature_b64}\`: the account's text and its signature, each base64.
- \`observation_attributions:\` per observation (or attested capture, by its SHA-256 as \`capture\`) the attribution \`level\` in force, which the grading method reads.
- \`grading_facts:\` one row per leg of each finding a member's chain reaches, \`{finding, ord}\` and the leg's fields (section 3), and \`passages:\` one row per relied-on passage, \`{finding, ord, content_id, capture_sha, extent, chain, quoted}\`. Each value that is not null, a number or a boolean is its canonical JSON in one single-quoted value. These blocks are what a grade is recomputed from and where a passage is said to be: the manifest is not signed, so a finding's \`grading_facts\` and \`passages\` files must say the same, row for row in \`ord\` order.
- \`calculations:\` one row per calculation any member's chain reaches, \`{calc, recipe, inputs, method_version, results, result_key, recompute, disclosed}\`: \`recipe\` the recipe in the closed grammar \`bio-calc/1\` (its canonical JSON in one single-quoted value); \`inputs\` each input's name and SHA-256; \`method_version\` the engine's version; \`results\` the stored results by key; \`result_key\` the SHA-256 of the canonical JSON of \`{recipe, inputs, method_version}\`; \`recompute\` the status recorded at the act (\`agrees\`, \`differs\` or \`unbound\`; a workbook row, whose \`calc\` is its capture's SHA-256, with no recipe, no inputs and a null \`result_key\`, may state \`not_recomputed\`); \`disclosed\` the publisher's disclosure of a differing or unbound calculation, or null. A grading leg of kind \`calculation\` names its row by \`calc\`.
- \`timeline:\` the published timeline, one row per item, \`{lane, ord, when, label, ref, source}\`: \`lane\` \`they_did\` (the world's events concerning the case's findings) or \`we_did\` (the group's own acts), every \`they_did\` row first, the two lanes never mixed; \`ord\` its place in its lane; \`when\` the item's when as held; \`source\` what it rests on (an item without one is not an item). The complete edition prints it.
- \`accepted_work:\` one row per member and leg resting on another group's finding, \`{member, leg_of, ref, group, case, edition, finding, manifest_sha, pair, result, gaps, accepted_by, accepted_at, reason}\`.

## 5. Signatures

Every signature is an armored SSH signature (SSHSIG) by an \`ssh-ed25519\` key, in the namespace \`bio-ratify\`, over the exact bytes of one statement:

- the case document: \`bio-ratify-case <case_id> <case_edition> <case_document_sha>\` and a newline;
- a member finding: \`bio-ratify <finding id> <version_sha>\` and a newline;
- a member's account of a capture: \`bio-capture-account <capture sha>\`, a newline, then the account's text.

The key a signature embeds must be among the manifest's \`keys\`. A checker given the group's published keys also says whether each signing key is among them; a checker given none says the keys were not checked against that list.

## 6. The complete edition

The complete edition is one HTML file rendered from the case file's other files, with every style inline, no script and no external reference. The same case file always renders the same bytes, so a checker renders it and compares. The product's name in its words (the credit at its foot, the line saying the case can be checked without the product, and the grading method's text) follows the case document's format: a \`bio-case-document/6\` document, or an earlier one, renders \`CivicOS\`, and a \`bio-case-document/7\` document renders \`Civicsmith\`. So a case file published before \`/7\` still renders its own carried edition byte for byte.

## 7. Canonical JSON, and the canonical extent

Canonical JSON is JSON with every object's keys sorted by code unit, no whitespace, a member that JSON cannot hold left out, and strings and numbers as \`JSON.stringify\` writes them.

An extent names a place in one document. Its canonical form is an object with fixed fields per \`kind\`, an absent field written null: an integer field that is not an integer is null; a string field is trimmed, and null when empty; a rectangle \`rect\` is four finite numbers reordered to \`[min x, min y, max x, max y]\`, else null; a cell is A1 notation (up to three letters and seven digits) with \`$\` removed and in upper case, else null; a range is two such cells, the top-left first, always written \`A1:B2\` (one cell \`B3\` is \`B3:B3\`), else null.

- \`document\` (the whole document): \`{kind}\`.
- \`pdf-page\`: \`{kind, page, rect}\` (\`page\` from 0).
- \`sheet-cell\`: \`{kind, sheet, cell}\` (the sheet's name as written, trimmed).
- \`sheet-range\`: \`{kind, sheet, range}\`.
- \`slide-shape\`: \`{kind, slide, shape}\`.
- \`doc-para\`: \`{kind, para, run}\`.
- \`doc-table\`: \`{kind, table, cell}\`.
- \`image\`: \`{kind, cited_as, part, page, rect}\`: \`cited_as\` as written, else \`bytes\`; \`part\` trimmed and in lower case.
- \`envelope\`: \`{kind, cited_as, item, part, at, name, n}\`: \`cited_as\` as written, else \`envelope\`; \`at\` the canonical form of the anchoring extent, or null; \`n\` an integer or null.
- any other kind: \`{kind, fields}\`.

Two extents of one document overlap when they are the same place, or one lies inside the other: anything lies inside \`document\`; otherwise the kinds are equal and the coarse field is equal (\`page\`, \`para\`, \`slide\`, \`sheet\`), and the fine field (\`rect\`, \`run\`, \`shape\`, \`cell\`) is absent on the outer one, equal, or (a rectangle) contained in the outer one.

## 8. Checking a case file

A checker answers, for each finding (a member, or a finding a member's chain reaches through its \`inquiry\` legs), one result: \`recreated\` (nothing missing, nothing differs), \`recreated_in_part\` (something is missing and nothing differs) or \`did_not_recreate\` (something differs). A check of the whole case that finds something missing or differing counts for every finding. Each entry names what is missing or what differs in words a reader can act on, such as a document to fetch with its fingerprint and origin.

1. Integrity. The manifest follows section 2. Every file's SHA-256 and length match its row; every part's files recompute its \`sha256\`. Since only the case document is signed, each material's carried bytes must also match the signed \`materials:\` row (\`sha\` for a document or an observation, \`text_sha\` for extracted text), a member's published bytes its \`version_sha\`, and each finding's grading facts and passages files the signed blocks. An absent file is missing for each finding that needs it; one that does not match differs.
2. Signatures. Each signature is verified as section 5 says; one that fails differs, for the case and every finding it covers. Each \`material_attestations:\` row is checked by its kind: a \`member\` row with a signature is verified over its account; a \`group\` row is the case document's signature; a \`project\` or \`co_attestation\` row must name a material the manifest lists. A failed row differs for each finding whose chain reaches that material.
3. Passages. Each passage's quoted text occurs (whitespace compared as single spaces) in its document's extracted text at its extent (the text of every unit whose extent overlaps the passage's, in order, joined by newlines; for an observation, its text), and its \`content_id\` is the SHA-256 (of the UTF-8 bytes) of the canonical JSON of \`{v: 1, capture_sha, extent, chain}\`, where \`extent\` is a string holding the canonical JSON of the extent in its canonical form, and \`chain\` a string holding the canonical JSON of the chain, or null. Not found differs; extracted text not carried is missing.
4. Grades. Each finding's pair is recomputed from its grading facts by the grading method the case states (\`method.grading\`), whose text is published with the case's complete edition. A recomputed grade unlike the recorded one differs; a method version the checker does not hold is missing.
5. The bar. A load-bearing member reaches the recorded bar on every declared axis, or differs naming each axis. A supporting member is not asked; a case with no bar has none to meet.
6. Publication checks. The case document passes the publication checks of the catalogue; a check that needs the publishing copy's record is named as not asked. When the case states another catalogue version than the checker's, the answer says the checks ran at the checker's version.
7. Presentability. Every material a load-bearing member's chain reaches is listed in \`materials:\` as \`included: true\` and carried whole (its bytes and extracted text, or an observation's text). Not carried is missing; not listed, or listed as not included, differs.
8. Completion. Bytes supplied later whose SHA-256 is a missing file's fingerprint fill that gap. Bytes whose SHA-256 is a calculation input's stated SHA-256, where the case file lacks that input (absent, or carried with other bytes), fill that input: the calculation is recomputed with them (rule 11), and every finding resting on it takes its new entries. Other bytes are named and never used.
9. The complete edition. The carried complete edition equals the one rendered from the rest of the case file, or differs.
10. Another group's work. A leg on another group's finding (\`imported\`) is recreated up to that leg: its grade is the \`accepted_work:\` row's \`pair\`, passages and material are not followed past it, it adds nothing missing, and the answer names that group's case file (group, case, edition, finding and manifest SHA-256) as the place to check it.
11. Calculations. Each \`calculations:\` row is recomputed by the \`bio-calc/1\` engine over the inputs the case file carries, each first checked against its SHA-256, at the method version the row states, and answered \`agrees\`, \`differs\` or \`not_recomputed\`. A result or result key that recomputes differently differs, naming the result, the stated and the recomputed value; an input absent or unlike its hash, or a method version the checker does not hold, is missing. A row the document discloses as differing or unbound is answered with that disclosure, and is not counted as differing for being so. A workbook, or a value from another engine, is answered \`not_recomputed\`, recomputed by the publishing copy's engine, never as agreeing. A finding whose chain rests on a calculation takes its entries.
