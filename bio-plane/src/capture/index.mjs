/* capture — what capture keeps (layer 3): the evidence store by digest, what capture learns about sources and sites
 * (reachability, site assets, links and the host's chrome, capture sessions, the platform's ceiling, the render
 * allowance), the event queue an undetermined capture raises, a member's upload (R86) and the information grammar
 * (`grammar.mjs`, C-2.7). The acquisition act is `acquisition`'s since T18 (K617): `acquire` and
 * `archiveLookup` hand it this module's store (R73). It writes no bundle: no intake path writes live state.
 * Requirements: build/requirements/capture.md (R8, R15, R21–R29, R37–R40, R43–R46, R55, R57–R59, R63, R64, R68, R69, R73–R79, R81–R96). Extracted from `legacy-store` and
 * `legacy-index` in T4 (T4-4); the reasoning the legacy comments carried is kept beside the code it explains.
 *
 * SHAPE (K61). `captureOf(ctx, opts)` answers the one instance for a Durable Object's storage. It reaches
 * record-core by `recordOf(ctx)` on the same `ctx` (the evidence store, `transact`, `declarePurge`, settings) and
 * membership's `viewerPredicate` (R43) for what a viewer may see, credentials' `attestingKeys` (its R11) for R69, and
 * attestation's `attest` (its R1–R3) for R68's late co-attestation, and holds attestation's instance for the storage
 * (`attestationOf(ctx)`), which the acquisition act reaches as `cap.attestation` to sign an archive-sourced receipt
 * (its R4; R73, K1224). It reads provenance's `register` and `captured_locators` only on their stated read contract (provenance R48). It
 * calls no later module: a later module registers a listener (R44, R55; `on`) or a reader (R78's batch examination,
 * R83's questions a document was captured for; `registerReader`). At its first construction for a
 * storage it registers its grammar (R89) and its figures (R75) with record-core.
 *
 * THE DOORBELL (T42, K2607; T43, N849; T44, N870). The doorbell (the knock, its rate and tallies, the inbox, the pull,
 * the knocker secret, the source fingerprint and its key; once this module's R30–R32, R47–R54, R56, R65–R67, R70–R72,
 * R80, R85) is `doorbell`'s; this module's copy of it was deleted in T43 (N849), its rows (R37) and tables with it, and
 * the last held piece, `sourceFingerprint`, in T44 (N870, K2708). This module answers no source fingerprint and creates,
 * declares and reads no table of `doorbell`'s, `knock_key` included (R87).
 *
 * T50 (T50-8). R94 `recordCapturedFor` records the asks `acquire`'s `for` makes (table `captured_for`); R83's reader is
 * handed them as `asks`, so R77 and R79 name the questions through it and this module names none itself. R95
 * `captureGradeOf` reads one capture's grade (`op=capturegrade`). R73 passes `openCaptures` through with this store. Plan
 * rule 6 (N1116): the member-facing sentences are read by key through `words.mjs`; this file holds keys, not English.
 *
 * T51 fix round 2 (the walk's C5, C12, C14, C26). An upload held in parts is kept whole too (R86); `recordLateAttestations` records an
 * attestation that ended after its capture was answered (R68); a page of held rows is read for the whole page at once and `fields:
 * "picker"` is the cheap read for a list to choose among (R77, R88); `heldAt` judges change on the determined substance digest (R96).
 *
 * T51 fix round 7 (the walk's G79, G78, G75, G73). An upload held in parts is answered once its parts are stored: the buffers of its parts are handed to
 * `keepWhole` (no part is read back), and a keep past `MULTIPART_KEEP_MAX` goes to the plane's ledger at once (R103); a draw of held captures asks the
 * evidence store no more for an object this instance has seen held (R77); `heldAt`'s compared copy names its document's `title` (R96).
 *
 * T51 (T51-21). R77's rows also answer `actor`, `retrieved` and `bytes`; R88's `held_and_vouched` lists the viewer's
 * vouched documents beside the held ones (`standing`, `vouched`); R96 `heldAt` (`op=heldat`) says whether the record
 * already holds an address or a digest and whether the source has since changed. The basis sentences of R88's vouched
 * rows and of R96's `changed` are held here as inline builder diagnostics: the screens draw their own keyed words from
 * the answer's `state` (words.json is the design stream's, and WORD_KEYS is its `reads` list for this module). */
