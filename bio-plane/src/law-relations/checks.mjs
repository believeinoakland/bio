/* law-relations' refusal rows (requirements: `build/requirements/law-relations.md`). DEC-49: every refusal this module
 * mints carries its code, its row and the member's translation, so a surface shows the same sentence wherever the act
 * is reached. Split from `standards` (K1961): the nine rows `standards/law.mjs` minted move here with their C-112 ids,
 * codes and translations kept (C-112 stays the family's id, nine of its rows held here, as C-69.4 and C-69.5 are held
 * apart from their family's other rows, K1907); each `where` now names this module's file, awaiting promotion's stamp.
 * C-112.29's translation names a policy among a court link's targets (R8), and C-112.53 (`LAW_RELATION_NO_EDITION`,
 * R9) is new; both await the stamp. The refusals named "the host's" in the requirements (`NO_SUCH_STANDARD`,
 * `PORTION_UNKNOWN`, `STANDARD_*`) are minted by `standards` and answered here as the host gives them. No translation
 * names a place (R17) or speaks of a law's merit (R18). */
