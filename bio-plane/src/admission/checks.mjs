  /* D-270 / BOB #17's THIRD SENTENCE, and it exists because the other two would
     otherwise have to cover a case neither is true of.

     **THE ARGUMENT, AND IT IS THIS ROW'S WHOLE REASON.** A false rationale
     SUPPRESSES ITS OWN BUG REPORT: a member told that an absence is a DECISION
     will not report it as a gap, so the sentence recruits the one person who
     could have caught it into believing there is nothing to catch. The measured
     case is D-136's — `adminendorse`, `adminremove` and `membercaps` WERE
     reachable by no session, and Membership Architecture §4.7 assigns that very
     vote to a person. **D-136 LANDED 2026-09-19 and discharged that case**: the
     three now hold `SESSION_OPS.admin` reach and a server-stamped `by`, so an
     administrator's session reaches them and a member's gets the ROLE sentence,
     not this one. The receipt stays in the past tense because it is the ARGUMENT
     for this row rather than a roster of its members — the gap was reported only
     because the plane declined to call it a decision, and deleting the evidence
     once the gap closes is how a rule outlives the reason it was made. `docs/archive/research/CAPABILITIES.md` (F-4) recorded
     independently that the old sentence told an administrator the act §4.9
     assigns them needs a credential §4.8 says somebody else holds, and that
     there is no action a member can take from it.

     SO THIS ROW STATES THE FACT AND INVENTS NO RATIONALE. It says what is true
     — no session route exists — and says plainly that the record holds no
     decision explaining it, which is an INVITATION to report the gap rather
     than a wall in front of it. A refusal may state only what the system can
