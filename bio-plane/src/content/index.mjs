/* content — the unit the record points at (requirements: `build/requirements/content.md`). A reference to a part of
 * a captured document, up to and including the whole: the extent grammar (`./extent.mjs`), the content address, the
 * content row minted over it and what it may claim on the transcription axis, a member's typed transcription of a
 * part and a second member's attestation of it, and, for one cited passage, whether a newer capture exists and
 * whether the passage is carried into it (`./notice.mjs`), or how it compares with a capture a caller found at
 * another address (R55), without moving anything. It never moves a reference: the record points where a member
 * pointed (R34).
 *
 * Extracted from the legacy modules (T5-3; K73, K102): `store.mjs` (the content writer REC-82, the reads REC-83,
 * transcription REC-87, the machine mint SK-7, the version notice's per-passage half D-394 / REC-221, and, by K73 (1),
 * the capture's text attestations CPDF-10 and the citation context `contentContextFor` with its readers),
 * `schema.mjs` (the four tables, now `./schema.mjs`) and `bio-checks.mjs` (the extent relation, the mint's
 * undetermined statement; in T19 the grammar's core, copied into `./extent-core.mjs`, R48). The legacy code's comments
 * moved with it, shortened where they only restated the code. Nothing in this module imports the catalogue: the
 * record's grammar is `record-grammar`'s, the extent algebra `text-chain`'s (see `./extent.mjs`).
 *
 * REACHED as `contentOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host (the Durable Object's `ctx`), created on the first
 * call with `deps`, returned to every later caller. At creation it declares its tables explicitly to record-core (R54, R39).
 * `deps`:
 *   record, membership, provenance   the modules it uses, through their factories on the same host unless a test
 *                                    passes its own.
 *   extraction   `extractionOf(host)` unless a test passes its own: `readingOf` (its R30), `unitsOf` (R36),
 *                `capturesReadFor` (R51) and `onReading` (R24), with which this module registers its stale mark.
 *                `noSha` (its R63), the one `NO_SHA` answer, is imported from the module itself, never from `deps`.
 *   now          the module's clock, an ISO instant (default: the wall clock); a mint or act with no `at` reads it.
 * At creation it also registers its stale mark with extraction (R22), its check and mint on provenance's testimony
 * slot (R49) and its figures with record-core (R51). Its route arms are `./ops.mjs`' `contentOps` (R50).
 *
 * Its refusal rows are `./checks.mjs`' (R38): C-52 moved there from the catalogue and C-80.3 copied (T18), C-45 copied
 * with the extent core (T19, R48). */
