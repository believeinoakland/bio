/* case-disclosures — what a case discloses about what it rests on, judged and written before anything is signed
 * (requirements: `build/requirements/case-disclosures.md`; BIO_Publication_v0_1.md §3 rules 4 and 16, §5C; DEC-76 item 4,
 * DEC-81, DEC-96 item 4, DEC-112, DEC-119). The unresolved conflicts on a case's findings (R1); each document's grade and
 * co-attestation, and the owner's acknowledgement of a self-attested one (R2, R3); what may be said of a source (R4); the
 * method the case is signed under (R5); every document and observation a finding's chain reaches, with what this copy
 * holds whole and who attests it, every photo and member document carried only as its copy and an unchecked photo
 * refused (R6–R12; T39, N806: a member document's copy, `case-carriage` R16), and the
 * photos it relies on for the ceremony's Photos step (R29; T37, N757; T38, DEC-183); another group's work it rests on, with its acceptance and open flags (R13,
 * R14); each reached finding's grading facts and passages (R15); hunch debt (R16); and the people it names, each with a
 * recorded basis, and each signer's attestation of no undeclared tie (R24–R28); (T41) the account and the four statements,
 * each sentence against what it cites (R30), and the bias applications of the findings it reaches (R31). Each judgment
 * answers its
 * refusals in order and the rows the case document writes; `case-authoring`'s `publishCase` asks them in its order (its
 * R55), answers the first refusal, and writes the rows through this module's renderers (`./document.mjs`).
 *
 * Split from `case-authoring` for size (K617, N529, K1333): its private methods moved here with their bodies unchanged
 * (`#x` → `x`), `materials.mjs` and `accepted.mjs` whole, the C-120 family (`./checks.mjs`) with its ids, codes and
 * translations, and the disclosure renderers, moved and not copied, so the signed document is byte-identical. Each
 * comment's requirement id is this module's; an id of `case-authoring`'s is named as its.
 *
 * THE SEAM (R23). Every service is synchronous and never throws on a failed read of another module: that read states
 * less, never more. It writes nothing of its own; it reaches two writes, each inside the caller's transaction, so the
 * caller can roll it back: `sources.sourceOf`'s minting of a source id (R4), and (T39) `case-carriage.documentCopy`'s
 * queueing of a member document neither queued nor derived (R6; its R16; K2374). It holds no table and no op, so it
 * declares nothing to purge and registers nothing.
 *
 * REACHED as `caseDisclosuresOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host (the Durable Object's `ctx`), created on the
 * first call with `deps`, returned to every later caller. `deps` (each reached through its factory on the same host
 * unless given; a test passes its own):
 *   record               layer 2: `readFile` (R6, R13).
 *   inquiry              `basisFor` (R16).
 *   strength             `gradingFacts` (its R35; R15).
 *   contradiction        `unresolvedRecordOn` (its R29; R1).
 *   provenance           `captureGrade` (its R24–R27, R51; R2).
 *   attestation          `attestationsOf` (its R7; R2).
 *   capture              `lateAttestationsOf`, `captureAccountsOf` (its R68, R69; R2, R3, R10).
 *   sources              `sourceOf`, then `publishableAt` (its R1, R8; R4).
 *   extraction           `unitsOf` (its R36; R6, R15).
 *   promotion            the fact `producingGroup` (R7's group row); `CATALOG_VERSION` is imported (R5).
 *   caseImport           `acceptanceOf`, `openFlagsOn`, `importedCase` (its R4, R9; R13, R14).
 *   entities             `readEntity` (a referenced entity's kind; R24).
 *   events               `readEvent` (a timeline item's participants, an act's date; R24, R25).
 *   lines                `readLine`, `structureAt` (a basis' line and its validity at the act's date; R25).
 *   money                `readFact` (a cited money fact's parties; R24).
 *   people               `identityOf`, `interestsOf`, `personAt`, `tiesConcerning` (its R5, R15, R14, R20; R24–R27).
 *   membership           `memberFacts` (a signer's cover or handle, at the level they chose; R27).
 *   caseCarriage         `photoMarks` (its R10; R6, R29); `OBSCURED_LABEL` and (T40) `PUBLISHED_LABEL` (its R11) are
 *                        imported (T37; N757);
 *                        `documentCopy` (its R16; R6), `COPY_CLEANED_LABEL` (its R15) imported (T39; N806). A member
 *                        document neither queued nor derived is queued by that read, case-carriage's one write, inside
 *                        the caller's transaction (its R16).
 *   bias                 `statementInForce` (its R49; R30: the statements this case's lens prints).
 *   caseChecker          `checkAccount` (its R24; R30), pure; imported unless given.
 *   now                  the judgment's instant, for the day `personAt` is read at (R26).
 * (T41) R31 asks `inquiry.biasAppliedFindings` (its R61's one in-force test, `biasNotInForce` its one spelling).
 *
 * READ CONTRACTS it joins in its own SQL, each named at its statement: record-core's `bundles` (R37); inquiry's
 * `inquiry_basis` (R40); content's `content` (R45); provenance's `register` and `captured_locators` (R48). Sight is
 * membership's one rule (`viewerPredicate`, its R43). */
