/* connections — the connections of the record (requirements: `build/requirements/connections.md`). Two kinds:
 * DERIVED connections, two captured documents that resolve to the same entity, graded the weaker of how each end
 * resolved (Framework §8, §8.1), each carrying the reference that determined it on each side, a member's choice of the
 * on-point mention, and what a cited part of a document may earn from it; and EDGES between bundles, the
 * `references[]` of every document projected so the record can answer who cites what (backlinks, dangling
 * references), `links_to` edges included. Beside them, kept apart and never rewritten by a derivation: a member's
 * own assertion of a connection (R31), a source's link between two held documents (R32), and an agenda item's
 * derived membership in a file (R49). And THEMES (Framework §8.4, K77): a connection through an idea, a lens for
 * finding material and never the basis of a claim (`./themes.mjs`).
 *
 * Extracted from the legacy modules (T5-5; K76, K77, K79, K102): `store.mjs` (FW-8's derivation, FW-17's pair,
 * REC-120's unchosen mention, REC-122's choice with D-454's occurrences, REC-5's dirty set, REC-19's live-cites
 * predicate, D-267's severance, REC-25's backlinks, C-6.2's dangling read, REC-52's link projection, D-162's themes),
 * `schema.mjs` (the tables, now `./schema.mjs`) and `bio-checks.mjs` (the two pair predicates, now `./pair.mjs`; the
 * C-49, C-74 and C-81 rows and `themeLegFindings` stay in the catalogue, whose own grammars call them, and are
 * re-exported here as their one public face). The built work on `land/worker/D-575`, `D-625`, `D-706` and `D-722`
 * is taken in (R6, R15, R26, R27). The legacy code's comments moved with it, shortened where they only restated it.
 *
 * REACHED as `connectionsOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host (the Durable Object's `ctx`), created on the
 * first call with `deps`, returned to every later caller. At creation it declares its tables to purge (R36), joins
 * every promotion (R19's projection, R23's fact, R29's notice) and every reading (R49's re-derivation).
 * `deps`:
 *   record, membership, promotion, content, extraction, capture   the modules it uses, through their factories on
 *                the same host unless a test passes its own.
 *   entities     `entitiesOf(host)` unless a test passes its own: `has`, `readEntity` (R1's label) and
 *                `onResolved` (its R13), on which this module marks dirt (R17); the resolutions themselves are read
 *                through their read contract.
 *   env          the bindings `CONNECTION_DERIVE_DELAY_MS` and `CONNECTION_DERIVE_BATCH` (R18).
 *   now          the module's clock, an ISO instant (default: the wall clock). */
