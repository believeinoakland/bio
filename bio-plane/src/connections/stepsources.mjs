/* connections — A SOURCE ATTACHED TO A DECLARED STEP (R68, R69, R36; T48-20; N1030, K3145, K1487 (3); `entities` R26).
 * A declared relation (`entities`' `REL-`) has no grade of its own, and `explore` walks it as "declared, not
 * evidenced". A member backs it with a passage of a held capture that states it: the attached source is recorded here,
 * apart from the relation, which stays declared and ungraded in `entities`. Each standing source is its own evidenced
 * fact, the kind `step_source` (class `evidentiary`), answered in `connection-grammar`'s shape for an entity node at
 * either end of the relation, graded no higher than the cited capture (`provenance.captureGrade`, through `content`).
 *
 * Read with this job's QUESTION J1 (T48): an extent is judged by `content`'s shape check (`canonicalExtent` never
 * refuses) and keyed by `canonicalExtent`; each evidence entry also names its `source` (the cited capture's bundle),
 * which `connection-grammar` R1 requires; a capture whose grade is not determined answers the lowest grade, stated. */
