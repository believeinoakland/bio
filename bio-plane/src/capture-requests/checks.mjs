/* =========================================================================
 * PL-4 / IS-4 / SWEEP 4b.1 — THE CAPTURE-REQUEST DOOR AND DEC-47's CONDUCT.
 *
 * DEC-47 CLOSED THE AUTHORISATION QUESTION AND LEFT CONDUCT OPEN. Bob,
 * 2026-08-06: *"the user has already said, in effect, I (we) have opened this
 * inquiry, which we're using this investigation session to answer. That's your
 * authorization."* A member asked to approve forty URLs *"has not done the
 * research and cannot judge them"*, so a per-fetch dialog adds paperwork without
 * judgement — the empty gate this project refuses everywhere else. NOTHING IN
 * THIS FAMILY ASKS PERMISSION. EVERY ROW IS ABOUT BEHAVIOUR.
 *
 * AND THE CONDUCT IS ENFORCED ONCE, AT THE DRAIN. Not at the request, not at
 * op=acquire, not in the fleet member. One point, so the rules cannot be half
 * applied by a caller that reached the store another way, and so a reader
 * looking for "how does this instance behave out there" finds one span.
 *
 * THE THREE CONDUCT RULES, and each is MEASURED rather than stylistic:
 *   1. A UA WITH A CONTACT URL. D-94's nine-rung ladder, second-path confirmed:
 *      removing the contact component flips admission 200 -> 403 UNIFORMLY. So
 *      this is not politeness, it is the thing that decides whether the fetch
 *      happens at all — and SOURCE-ACCESS.md's standing position is that BIO
 *      does not disguise its requests. BOB-3 permits the MEMBER'S OWN browser UA
 *      for publicly available documents, which is delegation rather than
 *      disguise (authorship is the distinction), and this family admits it as a
 *      SECOND LEGIBLE FORM rather than as an exemption from legibility.
 *   2. A PURPOSE TOKEN. The UA's `purpose` component is what lets a source tell
 *      a capture from a monitoring re-check, so an investigation fetch names
 *      itself rather than borrowing a word that means something else.
 *   3. RATE. The per-host governor already paces every outbound fetch; what the
 *      drain adds is that a host in COOL-OFF is not drained at all, and that one
 *      tick fetches at most once per host. DEC-47: a stranger's server has no
 *      relationship with this instance.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT A RULE HERE, and it is a RULING rather than an
 * omission: `robots.txt` DISALLOWS DO NOT BAR CAPTURE OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE
 * DOCUMENTS (BOB-3, RULED 2026-08-07, DEC-47's access-parity amendment —
 * *"members of this workflow should/must have rightful access to the same public
 * documents any manual user has access to"*). There is no robots row in this
 * family and the drain fetches no `robots.txt`. The module's R14 test
 * (`test/m/capture-requests/drain.test.mjs`) drives a document under a
 * `Disallow` path and asserts it CAPTURES, because a rule that is absent BY
 * DECISION needs an arm proving the absence is real.
 * ========================================================================= */

     reasoning does not reach these: the lead is a claim about the RECORD's own
     shape, checkable the instant it arrives and never again — the drain has no
