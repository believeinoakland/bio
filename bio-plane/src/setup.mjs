 *   UNBOUND   this plane holds no binding by that name — the member is unreachable FROM HERE whatever the account holds.
 *   SILENT    bound, and it did not answer a readable version within the bound (`why` says what happened).
 *   MISNAMED  something answered through the binding, but under another name — the binding points at the wrong worker.

 * D-436 / IC-172 — THE PRODUCING GROUP, ONE RECORDED VALUE FOR THE WHOLE INSTANCE (R1–R4).
 *
 * State Rules v1.5 §3.1: every bundle.md carries `group`, the producing group's slug, and it travels with every
 * distributed copy — so it is in the SIGNED bytes. There is ONE value, the `instance_group` row, and every default and
 * every stamp reads it through `producingGroup()`, which this module registers with promotion as the fact
 * `producingGroup` (promotion R40, R1 here). Nothing in the plane names a group of its own.
 *
 * DECISION (a), WHERE IT COMES FROM (K102). It is written ONCE, at the store's FIRST BOOT (record-core's `isFirstBoot`,
 * its R54): on that boot and on no other, the slug the installer bound as INSTANCE_NAME is recorded, the worker name
 * the group chose (D-102), which `newgroup` binds in the SAME upload that creates the worker. It is checked against the
 * installer's own slug grammar first, and a missing or malformed name records NOTHING — the store then says so.
 *   NEVER A DEPLOY-TIME VARIABLE AS ITS SOURCE. INSTANCE_NAME is the channel the slug ARRIVES by, read at one moment;
 *   every later boot ignores it. So a redeploy that moves the binding moves nothing already recorded.
 *   WHY THE FIRST BOOT AND NOT op=claim. The scratch namespace is a Durable Object of its own that no claim ever
 *   reaches; the root of trust can write before anyone claims; and a claim is RE-ARMED by rotating ADMIN_TOKEN, so
 *   "the first claim" would need a witness of its own. The store's birth is witnessed by the schema itself.
 *
 * DECISION (b), A STORE THAT PREDATES THE VALUE. A store that already held the schema when this table arrived records
 * NOTHING at boot, even with INSTANCE_NAME bound: the binding and the record can disagree, and choosing between them is
 * a person's act, not a boot's. It is recorded ONCE by the root of trust (`instanceGroupSeed`), and refused a second
 * time. The documents already written are not rewritten: their bytes are signed.
 *
 * DECISION (c), NOTHING RECORDED. A write that must name the producing group is never given a default (C-64.1,
 * promotion's): the fact answers null, and the writer refuses by name.
