/* standards — what a government act is measured against (requirements: `build/requirements/standards.md`; Functional
 * Architecture, Layer 2 Function 1). A standard is a statute, regulation, ordinance, court decision or order, adopted
 * policy or public commitment, held as content in the record: its citation, kind and issuer, its own words as captured
 * (content ids), where it comes from (a jurisdiction profile's `standard_sources`, or undetermined) and the period it
 * was in force. It answers which standards were in force at a date. It judges nothing about a government act
 * (`conformance` does) and nothing about a standard's merit (R12).
 *
 * A new module (K102, K171): nothing moves (its map, §1). A standard is a record document of type `standard` (R15),
 * `STD-<year>-NNNN-<kind>`, promoted through `promotion` outside any project (K171 (12)); `record-grammar` knows the
 * type (one state, `recorded`, no edges: N129). It is never edited: a correction is a new standard that supersedes
 * it, at most once (R4, R6). It is recorded with the declarer's reason, the member's own words on why the group
 * holds its government to it (R1, R10; DEC-88), never the proposer's `why`. Its registered check refuses every other
 * write of a standard (R11). The reads answer from this module's own tables (`./schema.mjs`), written once per act
 * and never updated (R14). A proposal (the Legal/Policy Lookup skill's work, or a member's suggestion) is stored apart
 * and labelled by `record-grammar`'s `proposalLabel(proposer, "standard")` (R9); a member's adoption records a
 * standard naming it (R10).
 *
 * No place is named here (R13): where a citation comes from is read from the active profiles' combined view
 * (`jurisdictions.combine` over record-core's `jurisdiction_profiles`), and a fact they do not supply is undetermined.
 *
 * REACHED as `standardsOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host (the Durable Object's `ctx`), created on the first
 * call with `deps` and returned to every later caller. At creation it creates its tables (R16), registers its check
 * with `promotion` (R39) and its tables with purge (R14). `deps`:
 *   record, membership, promotion, content   the modules it uses, through their factories on the same host unless a
 *                test passes its own (`content` is reached lazily, on first use).
 *   combine      `jurisdictions.combine` (default); a test passes its own, which resolves profiles it wrote by id.
 *   now          the module's clock, an ISO instant (default: the wall clock).
 *   events       `events`' instance, or a function answering it (R19, R20, R28: an event's `when`, through its
 *                `readEvent({eventId, viewer})`, events R26); `eventsOf(host)` by default (K1563 (1), K1574). Without
 *                one, an event bound or node answers undetermined, saying so, never a default.
 *   keyedStore   the store `acquisition.citationLookup` reads the group's key through (R25: `{credentials, env,
 *                governor}`), or a function answering it; absent, the keyed lookup answers that it is off.
 *   citationLookup, recognise   test seams: `acquisition.citationLookup` and `id-spaces.recogniseCitations` by default.
 *
 * T33 (T33-31; K1438, K1442, K1446, K1447, K1449): the module moved to layer 5. A declaration may name where the
 * standard sits in its law (R18, R19): its instrument key (composed only from profile data, `./instrument.mjs`), a
 * portion, the passages it requires, its copy, how current the copy is and what its period rests on. In force at a date
 * is R20's `inForceAt`, through `civil-time.validAt` over each version's period, bounded by adopted temporal relations
 * and by a codifier copy's lag; `inForce` stays its alias (Choices 18). Law relations, court links and treatment rows,
 * the citation resolver and the owner's read are `law-relations`' (K1961), constructed over this instance's reads and
 * delegated to (R48); the owner's registration at load stays here.
 *
 * T35 (T35-31): how much of a standard is held (text, cited, absent), its family, force per provision, the copy and what
 * it says of itself, sight from its source and its release, versions from captures, overrides, the source of force,
 * designation, edition and issuer, adoptions and the edition in force, access, targets, binding or benchmark, the
 * members' words (`./words.mjs`), a found extent and the question beside a declaration (R33–R47). */
