 * At creation it creates and declares its tables (R18). `ctx.recompute(captureSha)` is the plane's call to the
 * `SHEET_WORKER` binding; absent, a recompute records "not recomputed here: no engine bound" (R7).
 * `deps`:
 *   record, membership     record-core and membership on the same host unless a test passes its own.
