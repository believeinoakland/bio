/* journey-check R21 (K3803, K3813, K3815; DEC-330; amends R6, R13): the states of a carried screen that its default does not draw,
   each a LIVE and DESIGN pair at both widths. The design's state is drawn by setting the mock's own "In this mockup, show"
   control (`control`, the id of that select in the mock) to the option whose label matches `option`; the label is read from the
   mock, never copied here. The live screen is put in the state by `reach(page, ctx)` (the walk's own acts, or data the arm
   made), which answers true when it is there. A state the mock does not offer fails by its name; a state the walk cannot reach
   is a note "<screen>, <state>: not reached on this instance" on the live arm (never a pass, never a failure), listed for BOB's own live walk; on the
   local arm, which makes its own data, the same state fails by its name (kind `state`). */
