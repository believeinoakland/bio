/* intent — what the group is trying to achieve, turned into checkable work (requirements: `build/requirements/intent.md`;
 * Content Framework §12). Aspirations (standing, never close, set priority), goals (bounded pursuits that close) and
 * objectives (a project's aim, with a satisfaction condition the record is measured against). Progress on an objective
 * is computed from the record on every read and never stored or reported (R19); its gaps are the work list. Unasked-
 * for findings arrive as proposals, and only a member's act adopts one, sets it aside with a recorded reason, or (a
 * machine too) opens a question from it (the discovery loop).
 *
 * A new module (K102): C-2.9's objective arm was extracted from `legacy-checks` (`checkProjectExtension`) as R1 here,
 * run at the write as a registered promotion check and in the audit as a registered audit check, so neither loses it
 * (R22); C-2.9's `closed_reason` arm followed in T19 (R29) as this module's grammar (`./grammar.mjs`), registered with
 * record-core's grammar seam in record-grammar's `checkProjectExtension` slot (its `workproduct_state` and
 * `evaluations` arms and C-9.1 retired, K899 (3)). Aspirations and goals are record
 * documents of their own types (R26, `./doc.mjs`), written through `promotion` like every other record object, with
 * history, the gate and authored revisions; this module's
 * registered check holds their state machines (`held → retired`, `open → closed`) and who may write them.
 *
 * REACHED as `intentOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host (the Durable Object's `ctx`), created on the first
 * call with `deps` and returned to every later caller. At creation it registers its check with `promotion` (R39), its
 * audit check with `record-core` (R59), its tables with purge (R24) and its project grammar with record-core's grammar
 * seam (R29, `./grammar.mjs`). `deps`:
 *   record, membership, promotion, entities   the modules it uses, through their factories on the same host unless a
 *                test passes its own.
 *   progressions through its factory on the same host, reached on first use (N179: the plane's own instance, built
 *                with the plane's `env`, is the one read), unless a test passes its own.
 *   inquiry      `dispose` (R17); aiRuns `open` (R18); retrieval `selectionCreate` (R17: inquiry's dispose takes a
 *                selection, K198); captureRequests `requestById`, one request's outcome by key (R14, its R43; N291),
 *                and `captureRequests` and `bundlesOf`, a request's address and target (R28). Each through its
 *                factory on the same host, reached lazily on first use, unless a test passes its own.
 *   now          the module's clock, an ISO instant (default: the wall clock). */
