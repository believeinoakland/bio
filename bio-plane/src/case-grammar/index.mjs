/* case-grammar — the case document's grammar, one spelling for every module (requirements:

 * §4; N345, N364; D-431, D-442). Text in, values out: the formats and their predicates (R1, `./formats.mjs`), the `/5`
 * blocks (R1, `./blocks.mjs`) and tension section (R1, `./tensions.mjs`), the attribution run's text (R2), the
 * sections a later act re-authors (R3), the citations a signed document carries (R4), the edge set a finding rests
 * on (R5), what changed in an edition and the lens it was produced under (R8, R9, `./edition.mjs`), and the project
 * reference a case carries (R10, `./reference.mjs`), the method and materials a `/6` case carries and the other
 * group's work it rests on (R11, R12, R16, `./materials.mjs`), each finding's signed grading facts and passages and the
 * one extracted text (R17, `./facts.mjs`), the case file's format (R13, `./casefile.mjs`), the
 * complete edition (R14, `./complete.mjs`) and a finding's standing against the bar (R15, `./standing.mjs`). It reads
 * no table, holds no store and never throws.
 *
 * Split from `publication` by copy (K651, K624 (1)): the format block of `publication/checks.mjs`, and `fmSafe`,
 * `SECTIONS`, `REAUTHORABLE_SECTIONS`, `signedCitations`, the attribution renderers and `publishedGraphEdges` of
 * `publication/index.mjs`, with their comments. `publication`'s job deleted its copies and re-exports this module, so
 * its importers import what they imported before the split; a later importer imports this module directly. */

/* ===== D-431 — WHAT A FINDING "RESTS ON", NAMED ONCE, AND READ BY BOTH THE SERVING AND THE REFUSAL (R5) =====
   BIO_Publication_v0_1.md §3 rule 2, the second note (BOB #16, 2026-09-19): *"Rests on is the edge set the
   published graph already uses to decide it may serve an edge, named by the builder from the code and proved
   identical at both sites."* NAMED FROM THE CODE: the published graph is written by `publishEdges` from the
   edges `op=ratify` reads out of the RATIFIED BYTES, and it SERVES an edge only when the edge is of the
   `serve` class and its target is itself published. The `serve` class is every `references[]` entry (its
   `rel` as the kind, `cites` when none is authored); the two division disclosures are NAME-ONLY by kind and
   are never served. So a finding RESTS ON exactly the targets of its `serve`-class edges.
   This one function IS that edge set: `ratification` builds the graph it hands `publishEdges` from it, and
   `publication`'s `ratifiedFindingsRestingOn` asks it of each pinned finding's bytes — one function, two readers,
   so the refusal and the serving cannot come to read different quantities. A second spelling of this list
   anywhere is the defect it exists to prevent. */
