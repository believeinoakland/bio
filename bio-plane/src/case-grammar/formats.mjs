 * R1, which was `publication` R20). Copied from `publication/checks.mjs` (K651, K624 (1)), whose job then deleted its
 * copy and re-exports this module. `/5` also states R8's "What changed" block and R9's lens blocks (`./edition.mjs`;
 * DEC-101, DEC-103, K1019), with no `/6`: no `/5` document was stored when they were added. From T28 the format written
 * is `/6` (DEC-112 (3); K1268, BOB's decision 2): everything `/5` states, plus R11's `method:` block and R12's
 * `materials:` and `material_attestations:` blocks (`./materials.mjs`), required, so one predicate says "required"
 * without guessing whether a `/5` document is stored on a deployed plane. From T31 the format written is `/7` (DEC-124;
 * K1365 (1)), identical in fields to `/6`: every predicate holds for it as for `/6`, and the two differ only in the
 * product name the complete edition renders (R14, `./complete.mjs`). */

/* N345 (DEC-76 item 4, DEC-84 items 11–13, DEC-85): THE FORMAT MOVES TO /5, FOR THE REASON /3 AND /4 DID. A /5 document
   is one whose author was obliged to state the contradictions its findings rest on, one level deep, in its tension
   section (`case_tensions`), and each member's tension sentences; a /4 document had no place to, so a reader could not
   tell "none was disclosed" from "the format could not disclose one". /4, /3, /2 and /1 stay in the accepted set and
   are read exactly as written, never re-signed (rule 1).
   DEC-112 (3): THE FORMAT MOVES TO /6, FOR THE SAME REASON. A /6 document carries the version of the grading method and
   checks it was made under, and every document and observation its members' chains reach, with their attestations, so
   anybody can recreate it without a CivicOS copy; a /5 document had no place to. /5 joins the accepted set and is read
   exactly as written.
   DEC-124 (K1365 (1)): THE FORMAT MOVES TO /7, FOR ONE REASON ONLY. The product is renamed Civicsmith, and a /6 case
   file's complete edition must re-render byte for byte, so the name it prints is chosen by the format: /6 and earlier
   print "CivicOS", /7 prints "Civicsmith". /7 states exactly what /6 states. op=publish authors /7 only.
   T33-60 (C:A-12, C11; K1448, K1494): R18's `calculations:` and R20's `timeline:` blocks JOIN /7, with no /8, on R1's
   precedent. Neither is required: a document without either reads "none" from its reader, which is true of every
   document stored before T33, when no case could carry a calculation or a timeline.
   K3820 (R33; T51-136): THE FORMAT MOVES TO /8, FOR ONE REASON ONLY. The words a reader reads say "team" where they said
   "group", and a published `/7` case must re-render and re-spell byte for byte, so the words are chosen by the document's
   own format (`caseWordsOf`, `./words.mjs`): `/7` and earlier keep "group", `/8` says "team". `/8` states exactly what
   `/7` states, and `/7` stays accepted. op=publish authors /8 only.
   G47 (R1, R12; K4669, K4672): THE FORMAT /9 IS DECLARED BY A DOCUMENT THAT NEEDS IT, NEVER AUTHORED BY DEFAULT. A
   `material_attestations:` row may carry the `sha` of the capture it attests (R12), so a case of several captures of one
   source joins each attestation to its capture. A checker pinned before the field joins by `ref` alone and would give a
   wrong verdict on such a document; it answers "no specification" for a format it does not hold, so a document that
   carries any attestation `sha` declares `/9` (`caseDocumentFormatFor`) and one that carries none keeps `/8` and its
   bytes. `/9` states what `/8` states, plus that field, and speaks the same words. */
