/* project-roster — the acts on a project's working group that follow its setup: the roster and its removals record,
 * the owners' votes and an administrator's rescue, the visibility history and the directory, and requests to join.
 *
 * Requirements: build/requirements/project-roster.md (R1–R42; fix round 3 adds R42, `question_count` and `shared_drafts` on the list; T51 adds R35 `projectInvitations`, R36 the list's cursor, R37 `member_id` on requests, R38 `mine` and `scope` on the list; fix round 10 adds R43, `by` read in the door's form (`actorOf`), and R44, the requester told the answer and `projectRequestsAnswered`). T45 adds a project's scope (R21–R23: a counsel matter, a
 * member's own project; the guard membership calls before an invitation or a visibility change, its R128) and the
 * second-approval setting (R24), the acts it names checked against the active profiles' `action_kinds`; T46 (R25)
 * reads their refusals' words by key from `words.json` (`checks.mjs`' `said`); T47 (R26) lists the
 * projects a viewer sees at FULL with each one's recorded stage, R27 each one's opener and R28 its members and recent
 * activity. Split from membership for
 * size at T38 (N783; K617, K624, K2270: variant C1′ of `build/plan/membership-split.md`), by copy: each act's
 * behaviour is membership's as T37 left it, its answers byte for byte. Inviting, joining, leaving and removing, the
 * visibility setting, what a caller may see of a project, the fence and the participation record stay `membership`'s.
 * Design: docs/architecture/BIO_Membership_Architecture_v2.md §7.
 *
 * SHAPE (K61). `projectRosterOf(ctx)` answers the one instance for a Durable Object's storage, over `ctx.storage.sql`,
 * reaching record-core by `recordOf(ctx)` and membership by `membershipOf(ctx)` on the same `ctx`; a test may pass its
 * own as `projectRosterOf(ctx, { record, membership, clock })`. This module writes only its own five tables (`schema.mjs`).
 * It reads membership's tables only through membership's stated read contract (its R120) and writes them only through
 * `participationWrite` (its R118); it joins record-core's `bundles` and `manifest` only on its read contract
 * (record-core R37) and asks every other bundle fact of `core.bundleInfo` (R34). Calls go one way: membership never calls this module but
 * through the two notice slots and the one guard this module registers in (membership R116, R117, R128). */
