/* question-explorer — the system exploring a question on its own where an account owner turned exploring on
 * (requirements: `build/requirements/question-explorer.md`, R1–R14; D33, D36, D39, D11–D14, D66; N815).
 *
 * `questionExplorerOf(host, deps)` answers the one instance per Durable Object storage (K61). What it does:
 *   - chooses (R1, R2, R9): each tick reads at most 200 open or surfaced questions, keeps those worth exploring, and
 *     asks `ai-use.exploreAllowed` for each account owner whose scope may hold the question;
 *   - opens (R3, R12): an `investigate` run with `origin: "explore"`, whose system step on the question `ai-runs` creates
 *     once the run is open (its R73, K2490),
 *     and use `explore` through `ai-runs`, the paying owner its principal and `ai-use` R6's label, its estimate kept;
 *   - holds the acts the run's work goes through (the model work itself is `agent-worker`'s, later in the order): a
 *     look aimed at a person (R9, R10), a find with its gauge (R4), a capture asked through `capture-requests` (R3), a
 *     read inside a held document (R13), and the run's end (R8, R12);
 *   - offers (R5, R7, R14): each find once to each member following the question, only while the gate is open, every
 *     find alike whatever its bearing; and the member's own doors (R6).
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO: it writes no leg, no grade, no conclusion, no hypothesis and no score (R4, R6); it
 * computes no bearing (the run's work gauges; this module records the gauge with the gate's false-alarm rate); it
 * captures nothing itself (R3); it names no place in behaviour or outward text (R8); and it never decides the gate
 * from a group's own test investigations (R11).
 *
 * Providers built in T41 alongside it (`steps`, `ai-use`, and the T41 services of `ai-runs`,
 * `capture-requests`, `run-productions`) are taken through `deps` and read by their requirements' names; where one is
 * absent the module fails closed: the gate stays shut and nothing is explored. */
