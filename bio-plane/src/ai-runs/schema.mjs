-- IS-6 / INVESTIGATIVE-SESSION.md §11: THE RUN IS AN OBJECT, and it is built on
-- the capture_sessions shape above rather than on a new one — "SCRATCH, not
-- record… a work list with an expiry": ticks, an expiry, opaque state,
-- resumable across invocations. Every column beyond that shape is one §11 or
-- §14b.6 names, and each is here because a version is only interpretable
-- against the conditions it was formed under.
--
-- THE LEASE IS THE HEARTBEAT AND 'expires' IS IT. A run extends it on every
-- tick. A run that is KILLED extends nothing, so the lease lapses and the
-- ai-run-reap scheduler consumer terminates it — which is how the observation
-- log gets its terminal entry for a run that never ran its own exit path. That
-- is the whole of §14b.6's guarantee and the reason this column is not merely a
-- TTL for tidiness.
--
-- TWO PRINCIPALS, NEVER ONE (§14a, DEC-27(b), DEC-55.4). 'principal_plane' is
-- the plane credential ('token:<class>' or a member id); 'principal_claude' is
-- WHICH LEVEL of the Claude-account cascade paid — member, then project, then
-- instance. They are two different principals and an act must say both. NEITHER
-- IS EVER A TOKEN VALUE: 'principal_claude_ref' is a label the operator
-- configured, not a secret, and nothing in the plane writes a credential here.
--
-- NO TRANSCRIPT COLUMN, AND THAT IS DEC-61 (Bob, 2026-08-06). The model's
-- reasoning is DEVICE-LOCAL, TTL'd and deleted at publication, and never in the
-- record store. 'state' is the run's resumable SCRATCH — its work list — and
-- the observation log below is a structured account of where the search went.
-- Neither is a transcript, and there is no column here one could be put in.

-- §14b.6's budget, ONE ROW PER BOUND, with its live consumption beside it.
-- Rows rather than columns because F11 (§19, carried by UI-38) requires the
-- surface to render the budget and its consumption while the run is live, and
-- its renderers are field-name-blind — they walk what the record published. A
-- bound added later is a row, and nothing on any surface moves.
--
-- BOTH NUMBERS ARE STORED. UI-38 derives nothing and its suite fails any
-- arithmetic in the rendered output, so the record must publish 'allowed' and
-- 'consumed' separately; a percentage or a remainder computed here would only
-- move the same defect one layer down.

-- D-85 (INVESTIGATIVE-SESSION.md section 11 item 5, rule 2, BOB #25, 2026-09-21): AN ASSISTANT OPENS A
-- QUESTION ONLY INSIDE A RUN. When an 'ai' credential creates an inquiry it names a RUNNING run whose
-- principal it is, and the plane records the link HERE, keyed by the new inquiry. It is an INSTANCE row and
-- never a line in the inquiry's signed bytes: the run is scratch and is never published, and a pointer in
-- published bytes that no reader can resolve is not provenance. One row per inquiry (an inquiry is created
-- once). Its principal is the control plane's stamp for the credential that created it, never a field it sent.
-- The column is named bundle_id so the row rides purge's TABLES list and clears in BOTH arms (D-113).
-- NO index beyond the key: every reader asks by the inquiry.
