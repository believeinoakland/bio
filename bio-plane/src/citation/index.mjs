/* citation — citing, in the record's own terms "this is why I think that" (requirements: `build/requirements/citation.md`).
 * On a case (a `project`) a citation is a `cites` edge in the case's `references[]`; on a question (an `inquiry`) it is
 * a leg of the question's `basis[]`, with the target in its references too. This module holds that act (`cite`, R1–R3),
 * a case drawing one question in without a selection (`drawQuestion`, R14), its withdrawal and restoration on a case's
 * edge or a question's leg (`sever`, `reinstate`, R4, R15: status changes, never deletions) and the one rule
 * of what may be cited now (`retiredNotCitable`, R5), and the read of who cited a captured passage (`recordedBy`, R13,
 * `./recorded.mjs`), registered with `retrieval` (its R76) where `citationOf` first makes it. A question may also rest on
 * another team's accepted finding at a named edition, and take that leg back (`citeImported`, `withdrawImported`, R16, R17). It judges nothing about a leg's grammar, grade or the basis
 * graph: it composes legs, and `inquiry` judges them at the write (its R11), as it judges every other leg.
 *
 * Extracted from the legacy modules (T7, T6-2; K3, K64, K83, K102, N55): `store.mjs` (`cite`, `#edgeTransition`,
 * `sever`, `reinstate`, `#retiredNotCitable`, `#spliceEdgeStatus`, `#legExtentLines`, `#spliceBasis`, the three
 * `CITE_*` bounds and `EDGE_NOTE_MAX`, and the three ops' dispatch entries) and the legacy check catalogue
 * (`legacy-checks`: rows C-33.15–C-33.19, C-33.39 and C-45.7–C-45.10, now `./checks.mjs`). The record grammar it reads
 * (`normalizeType`, `OBJECT_TYPES`, `parseFrontmatter`, `createSha256`) is `record-grammar`'s. The legacy code's
 * comments moved with it, shortened where they only restated it.
 *
 * A CITATION EXISTS ONLY IN THE CITING DOCUMENT'S BYTES (R6, D-21). Both acts write the document and promote it; `refs`
 * and `inquiry_basis` are projections of those bytes (`connections`', `inquiry`'s), re-derived inside the promotion, and
 * this module writes neither. That is what makes the write's leg grammar and its cycle guard unavoidable rather than
 * merely available: there is no path from here to either table.
 *
 * FULLY SYNCHRONOUS, and that is load-bearing: nothing between resolving the selection and committing the promotion
 * awaits, and a Durable Object is single threaded, so no other write can interleave. The compare-and-swap is still
 * passed, as a backstop.
 *
 * REACHED as `citationOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host (the Durable Object's `ctx`), created on the first
 * call with `deps`, returned to every later caller. `deps`:
 *   record, membership, promotion, content, retrieval   the modules it uses, through their factories on the same host
 *                unless a test passes its own.
 *   provenance   `{homeOf}` (provenance R4): the document a found match's capture is held in (R1, T35); by default
 *                `provenanceOf(host)`.
 *   inquiry      `{earned, checkLegExtentGrammar, BASIS_ROLES, restingOn}` (inquiry R13, R5, R4, R12): the earned registry that fills a
 *                leg's grade, the one leg-part grammar, and the role vocabulary; by default `inquiryOf(host)`'s
 *                registry with the grammar and roles inquiry exports. One lacking any of the three refuses citing onto
 *                a question `INQUIRY_UNAVAILABLE` (never written ungraded by default); `restingOn`, the leg projection
 *                read back, is how R13 finds a capture's legs.
 *   acceptedWork `{acceptedFinding, openFlagsOn}` (accepted-work R2): the facts at an edition that `citeImported`'s receipt
 *                carries as `origin` (R16); by default `acceptedWorkOf(host)`. Its refusal itself runs inside the write.
 *   storage      the Durable Object's storage (default `host.storage`): R13 reads record-core's `bundles` contract (its R37)
 *                through its `sql` in one statement.
 *   now          the module's clock, milliseconds since the epoch (default: the wall clock). */
