/* Standing questions (R15–R21, R26, R27; L5; K1481, K1500, K1502, K1503, K1755; DEC-139 (7)). A member keeps a
 * question with the saved query shown when it was set (the one the assistant wrote, or the one the member made in the
 * search's own form), a cadence and an end date. None of it asks for an account: a member no account serves sets,
 * runs, sees and ends one as any member does, and its new finds reach them once as a list, read by no model (R26).
 * The scheduler's tick re-runs each due question's saved query under its author's sight at that moment, with no model
 * call (R17); a run finds something new only when its result holds an id the previous run's did not, or an occurrence
 * it reads changed state (R18). Only then may the AI half answer, and only when every condition of R19 holds; it is
 * built switched off (plan Rules (7)). A question, its runs
 * and its finds are seen by its author alone (R16), and it reads nothing outside the asking scope (R21). Setting or
 * ending one tells each module listening (R27), so the scheduler re-arms its wake.
 *
 * A standing find (R28; DEC-164 (6), K1865) keeps a find in place of a saved query: "Keep finding this as documents
 * arrive", over a scope as `retrieval.findIn` takes it. Each run calls `findIn` under its author's sight, page by page,
 * and keeps the matches' keys (kind, capture, extent and the words as read); a match is new when its key was not in the
 * previous run's. No model is ever called for it and it needs no account; its new matches reach the author once, as one
 * entry, marked "Found by search", never "machine work". It records nothing else (DEC-164 (4)).
 *
 * These are the `Answers` instance's methods' bodies (`self`); `index.mjs` binds them. */
