/* following — the group's following of what happens at a body and in a register, on the scheduler's one alarm
 * (requirements: `build/requirements/following.md`; ladders §4.4, §5B.4, §6.4, §7.4, §8.5; K1443, K1444, K1449, K1468,
 * K1484). A body a member follows is read from its Legistar records so that `events` writes what it did; a document
 * watched per meeting is captured before each meeting by the body's notice period; a public register is re-read (or
 * re-rendered) on the tick, and one behind a member's account or a fee only at that member's act; a member may follow
 * a register's own query for one identifier naming a person; a portal's dataset is snapshotted and diffed by key.
 * Each policy the group holds is watched at its published copy with no member act, every version seen kept, its
 * changes read by `notice-producers` (R20, R21; K1727, K1740). Like `monitoring`, it watches and captures; what a
 * change means is never its to say (R16).
 *
 * New code beside `monitoring` (plan T33 Choices 7; no copy seam was found). Every tick runs under
 * `monitoring.sweepHost()` (its R65: one pause, one idempotence key, one landing), as `link-sweep` does (N506).
 *
 * REACHED as `followingOf(host, deps)` (K61, K1563 (1)): one instance per host, created on the first call; it creates
 * its tables and declares them with their classes (R17). `deps` (each reached through its factory on the same host
 * unless given; a test passes its own):
 *   record, membership   layer 2: `transact`, `declareTable`, `getSetting`, `evidenceStore`; `inSight`.
 *   capture              `acquire` (its capture-request arm; the render path, R7; a member's own credential, R8).
 *   entities, events     a body's existence and Legistar identifier (R1); its observed meetings (R4) and the
 *                        Legistar write (`followedImport`, R2).
 *   monitoring           `sweepHost()` (R13), `schedule(now)` (R4: the `per_meeting` subjects), `monitor` (R4's capture).
 *   standards            the held policies (`standardsIn`, `standardRead`), who may read one (`isMeasure`), and the
 *                        amendments of one (`lawRelationsOf`) (R20, R21). A policy's text capture is read through
 *                        `content`'s read contract (its R45) and its address through `provenance`'s (its R48).
 *   view                 the jurisdiction view, or a function answering it (default: `jurisdictions.combine` of the
 *                        instance's active profiles, record-core R26).
 *   actionPlans, planWork the plan read (state, closing instant, matters, project; `NO_SUCH_PLAN`, `PLAN_CLOSED`), each
 *                        matter's adopted promise-duties with the instant they were all read met (`matterPromiseDuties`,
 *                        its R13, R15: R27's one source) and the watch-reader door this module
 *                        registers with at start (`registerWatchReader`) (R23, R24, R26).
 *   duties, answers      a duty's sight and words; a standing question's sight, words and `ends`, and
 *                        its author's acts ending it or moving its end (R23–R26).
 *   monitoring           also an address's rows with their end date (its R32), `addressWatchEnd` (R71) and
 *                        `addressWatchers` (R72) (R23–R25).
 *   actions, actionClocks a proceeding's actions (`actionsFor`, its R30, R65) and the group's own deadlines
 *                        (`ourDeadlines`, its R18) (R30). The refusals of R29 are `entities`' (`noSuchEntity`,
 *                        `notAProceeding`, its R36, R53; R31).
 *   retrieval            `registerBrowseMarks`, the door this module registers its read of watch marks and second-look flags
 *                        with at start (its R86; R34).
 *   now                  the instance clock in milliseconds.
 *   bytes(sha)           a capture's bytes (default: record-core's evidence store). */
