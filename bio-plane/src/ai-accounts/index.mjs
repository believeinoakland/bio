/* ai-accounts — the AI accounts the assistant's use is paid by, sealed at rest, and the choice of the one an act uses.
 * From T53 an account is an owner's plan at a provider (R40), reached by one of five means (`gateway`, `sealed`,
 * `reference`, `issued`, `none`) and holding an ordered allow-list of the entries of `ai-catalogue`'s signed list; an
 * owner (a member, a project, the team) keeps one ordered list of accounts (R41), and which account serves an act is the
 * walk of that list under the plan's scope, the checks P1–P7, Gate 1's verdict per part, the account's switch for the kind of
 * use, the free-tier warning, the recipient's notice and the payer flag (R7, R11, R42–R57). The material limits that keep a
 * team's or a project's material away from AI (R20–R22), the notices and disclosure owed before an account pays, and each
 * account's change history (R16) are here too. Who the members are is `membership`'s; what a person signs in with, and the
 * grant an ask reads under, are `credentials`'.
 *
 * Requirements: build/requirements/ai-accounts.md (R1–R77). Split from `credentials` by copy at T48 (R1–R34; N996, K617,
 * K624, K3101); T53 (K5457, N1220; AI-DESIGN's drafts, DEC-465, DEC-466, DEC-471, DEC-476, K5478, K5493, K5501) replaced the
 * one-table-per-kind accounts with the account model of R40 on, retired twelve ops (R35) and declared the new ones (R61, R71),
 * and `migrate` converts today's rows (R59).
 *
 * SHAPE (K61). `aiAccountsOf(ctx)` answers the one instance for a Durable Object's storage, over `ctx.storage.sql`, reaching
 * record-core by `recordOf(ctx)` and membership by `membershipOf(ctx)` on the same `ctx`; credentials' factory creates it with
 * the Worker's seal secret (`sealSecret`, R24, R32) and `ai-catalogue`'s service (`catalogue`), and a test may pass its own
 * `{record, membership, sealSecret, catalogue}`, read on the first call only. Its first construction is this module's start:
 * it registers its two listeners with membership (R27, R77). It reads only record-grammar, record-core, membership and
 * ai-catalogue, and membership only through its services, never by SQL. Every refusal names its reason; no service throws.
 *
 * The class is built in layers, one file each, each extending the one before: base (clock, refusals, authority, seal,
 * catalogue reads, disclosure), limits (R20–R22), accounts (R40 and what is stored of one), lists (R41, R46, R49), offering
 * (R47, R51–R56), serving (R7, R11, R50, R65–R68, R74–R76) and lifecycle (R27, R59, R72, R77, migrate). */
