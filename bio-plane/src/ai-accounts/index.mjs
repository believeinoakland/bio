/* ai-accounts — the AI accounts the assistant's use is paid by, sealed at rest, and the choice of the one an act uses:
 * a member's own (an API key, or her Claude sign-in's token), a project's, and the group's API key; each account's
 * switch for every kind of use; the material limits that keep the group's or a project's material away from AI; the
 * notices and the disclosure owed before an account pays; and each account's change history. Claude is today's only
 * provider. Who the members are is `membership`'s; what a person signs in with, and the grant an ask reads under, are
 * `credentials`'.
 *
 * Requirements: build/requirements/ai-accounts.md (R1–R34). Split from `credentials` by copy (T48-10; N996, K617, K624,
 * K3101; `build/extraction/credentials-split.md` §2): the code below is credentials' as it stood at T48's START, with
 * no refusal text, code, number or translation changed and the seal byte-identical (HKDF salt and info
 * `bio-credentials-seal/1`, AAD `owner|kind`), so every row sealed before opens; the table names and columns are
 * unchanged, so a running store keeps its rows. Its R1–R23 are credentials' R22–R25, R33–R37, R54, R56, R58, R59,
 * R55, R60–R62, R43, R70, R51, R52, R57 and R64, renumbered; R24–R33 are the split's seams and its shares of
 * credentials' invariants; R34 is T48's one addition (`aiKeptAway` never answers AI_KEPT_AWAY without its row, and
 * `KEPT_AWAY_UNREADABLE`). Two acts change at the seam (map §1, §3): the ask grants and run credentials that end when
 * a reference is removed or a sign-in cleared are credentials', so this module tells them through `onAccountCleared`
 * (R26) instead of writing credentials' tables; and `#retiredReferences` no longer deletes grants (map doubt 5).
 *
 * SHAPE (K61). `aiAccountsOf(ctx)` answers the one instance for a Durable Object's storage, over `ctx.storage.sql`,
 * reaching record-core by `recordOf(ctx)` and membership by `membershipOf(ctx)` on the same `ctx`; credentials'
 * factory creates it with the Worker's seal secret (`sealSecret`, R24, R32), and a test may pass its own
 * `{record, membership, sealSecret}`, read on the first call only. Its first construction is this module's start: it
 * registers its revocation listener with membership (R27). It reads only record-grammar, record-core and membership,
 * and membership only through its services, never by SQL. Every refusal names its reason; no service throws. */
