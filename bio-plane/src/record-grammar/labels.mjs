/* =====================================================================
 * REC-195 (D-149's remaining half; `BIO_Case_Making_v0_1.md` §2): A MACHINE'S
 * PROPOSAL OF THE LIST, LABELLED MACHINE WORK.
 *
 * The ruling's own words are *the machine may propose the list from the
 * counterparty, labelled as machine work, and never sets it*. D-149 built the
 * fence (C-32.18) and left the proposal unbuilt. The proposal is stored APART
 * from the member's list — it is not `governing_laws[]`, it is not in the
 * action's bytes, and no read composes the two — so the only thing this block
 * has to get right is the LABEL.
 *
 * THE LABEL IS THE PLANE'S OWN ANSWER, NOT A LITERAL FOR A SURFACE TO MATCH,
 * and this is `CONTENT_MINT_STATES` one construct over, for its reason exactly
 * (PL-17: *a surface that reads the field itself and matches on the literal has
 * rebuilt the predicate*). `proposed_by` holds an identity — a machine stamp,
 * or a member handle — and a surface rendering that identity verbatim prints a
 * machine word at a member. So the plane answers the QUESTION and publishes the
 * SENTENCE.
 *
 * THE BLOCK IS PRESENT ON EVERY PROPOSAL, not only on machine ones, for
 * `#mintLabel`'s stated reason: a key that appears only when the answer is
 * "machine" makes ABSENCE carry the meaning, and a surface that never learned
 * the key then renders nothing at all for a machine's proposal — which is the
 * failure the label exists to prevent, arriving as silence.
 *
 * THE READING IS TOTAL: three states, every `proposed_by` lands in exactly one,
 * and `unstated` is a STATED answer rather than a gap. A proposal nobody can be
 * named for is refused at the act, so `unstated` is not reachable through the
 * control plane today; it is kept because the reading is a property of the
 * VALUE, and a reader handed a row from anywhere must land somewhere honest.

 * WHO MINTED THIS CONTENT ROW (SK-7, out of framework Part II 14.4 —
 * Bob's ruling of 2026-09-14, folded there as 5.7).
 *
 * THE RULING, in its own words: *"The assistant may mark passages as citable
 * on its own, every such row labelled as machine work, never attested by it,
 * and part of a finding only when a member cites it."* Three obligations, and
 * this block is the FIRST of them. The second is C-35.10, which is UNCHANGED
 * and is asserted unchanged. The third is structural and is asserted where it
 * is structural (`earnedBasisRegistry` answers `earned.content` only over the
 * content ids a CALLER named, and the only caller that names them is a basis of
 * legs a member authored).
 *
 * WHY A PUBLISHED STATE MAP RATHER THAN A BOOLEAN ON THE ROW, and the
 * precedent is one field over rather than an argument from taste. PL-17 /
 * DEC-65 met exactly this shape on `asserted_by`: the column holds an IDENTITY,
 * a surface renders the identity verbatim, and the moment the field can hold a
 * machine word the surface prints a machine word at a member. `content.minted_by`
 * is that column again — it holds `plane`, a member handle, or a control-plane
 * machine stamp — and a surface that renders `Asserted by ${…}` verbatim is one
 * field over from it. So the plane answers the QUESTION and publishes the
 * SENTENCE, and the surface renders what it was given (DEC-49's rule reaching a
 * published vocabulary's texts, `SUFFICIENCY_CLAIM_STATES`' own words).
 *
 * THE READING IS TOTAL, which is what makes "labelled everywhere" checkable:
 * four states, every `minted_by` lands in exactly one, and `unstated` is a
 * STATED answer rather than a gap (CLAUDE.md — undetermined is first-class).
 *
 * `plane` IS NOT `machine`, AND THAT DISTINCTION IS THE LOAD-BEARING ONE.
 * A row minted at `op=promote` is the mechanical referent of a citation A
 * MEMBER AUTHORED — the member named the passage in their own basis and the
 * record minted the row to hold it, in the same transaction. Calling that
 * "machine work" would label a member's own citation as the assistant's, which
 * is the ruling read backwards and would put the label on the wrong act. What
 * 5.7 is about is a row NOBODY cited: a machine credential marking a passage
 * citable on its own initiative, which is why that state's sentence says out
 * loud that no member has cited it yet.
 * ===================================================================== */
