     `## Statements` is the prose the members read; the STATEMENTS THEMSELVES
     live in frontmatter as `statements[]`, exactly as an inquiry's legs live in
     `basis[]`, because D-21 forbids a second place to state a fact and the
     projection below is a projection of the DOCUMENT.
     `## Adoption` is where the group records the process by which it adopted
     this set. The doctrine deliberately does not define that process — "defined
     and documented by that group, in the group's own process document" — and
     requires only that adoption is a recorded, member-authored transition. So
     the heading is where the group's own account of it lands, and it is what
     makes `op=biasadopt`'s row point at something a reader can check.
     `## What This Does Not Enforce` IS DEC-54 (b) IN THE DOCUMENT'S OWN BYTES.
     The ruling is that the unenforceable residue is "a first-class published
     output, not a log line": a case saying "held to AP's standards" must also
     say which of AP's standards this system does not check, because in four of
     five documented verification failures the countable rules were formally
     satisfied while the uncountable properties failed. A residue that lived
     only in an op's answer would be exactly the log line the ruling refuses —
     it would not travel with the bundle, and a stranger reading the bytes after
     this instance is gone would meet the enforcement without the caveat. It is
     REQUIRED IN EVERY STATE rather than only in `adopted`, and C-26.7 refuses
     it EMPTY on an adopted bundle, because a heading nobody filled is the

     `divided` still wait for REC-14/16, and they arrive TOGETHER WITH their

     which is why `concluded` landed here in the same turn as
     checkInquiryExtension's concluded arm (inquiry-grammar's today) and op=conclude.
     `surfaced` is a LEGAL ALIAS of `open` (DATA-MODEL §2.7's recommendation):
     rewriting it would invent an authored fact and set current_state
     disagreeing with the document's own state_history (C-4.2), so it stays
     legal, appears wherever `open` appears — INCLUDING the new conclude edge,
     because refusing to conclude an inquiry merely because it spells its open
     state the old way would be the trap the alias exists to avoid — and the
     drift stays visible. `open` is legal[0] deliberately — setup.mjs derives
     FIRST_STATE from it.

     REC-13's edges, and only these: `open <-> concluded` both ways (a
     conclusion is revisable — reopening is how a group says the answer did
     not hold), and `concluded -> deferred|dismissed`, because a conclusion
     nobody publishes STILL AGES (D-79: a finding that silently stops being
     worked on is indistinguishable from one never made). Deliberately NOT
     added: `deferred -> concluded` and `dismissed -> concluded`. Concluding
     something the group set down means picking it back up first, and the
     machine already carries deferred/dismissed -> open for exactly that.
     `concluded -> surfaced` follows the table's own convention, where every
     existing edge into `open` names the alias beside it. */
  /* ============ CASE-4 / DEC-72, 2026-09-10: `published` LEAVES THIS MACHINE.
     THE STATE GOES; THE PRECONDITION IT ENFORCED DOES NOT, AND THAT DISTINCTION
     IS THE WHOLE ITEM.

     Bob's ruling (DEC-72) makes a case ITS OWN OBJECT — a set of
     finding-versions plus the publishing project — rather than a phase of a
     finding. `CASE-AS-PRODUCTION.md`: *"A finding's lifecycle ends at
     `concluded`; publication is the case relation."* Its supersession table
     rules on this table by name: *"`published` as an inquiry lifecycle state
     (State Rules per-type machine; ILLEGAL_TRANSITION publishing-only-from-
     concluded) — the precondition survives as 'only a CONCLUDED finding may be
     a case member'; the state itself becomes the case relation."*

     WHAT `concluded: [... 'published' ...]` WAS ACTUALLY DOING, and it is why
     deleting it alone would have been a defect rather than the change. That one
     array entry was carrying TWO facts at once. The first is that publishing
     moves the document to a new lifecycle state — that fact is what DEC-72
     deletes. The second is that publishing is reachable from `concluded` AND
     FROM NOWHERE ELSE — a material set cannot be asserted over a question with
     no conclusion — and THAT fact survives the ruling untouched. Because both
     rode on one array entry, removing the entry removes both: with no
     `published` anywhere in `edges`, the old guard
     `legalFrom.includes("published")` is false from EVERY state, which reads as
     a gate that refuses everything and is in fact a gate that has stopped
     asking. So `publishCase()` now carries the precondition EXPLICITLY, as its
     own named refusal (`NOT_CONCLUDED`) over `concluded` alone. A rule that used
     to be a side effect of a table is now a sentence, which is the only form in
     which it can survive the table.

     `published` IS STILL IN `legacy` BELOW AND THAT IS NOT A HEDGE. Ratified
     bytes are immutable and a store that has published anything holds documents
     whose frontmatter says `current_state: published` — bytes whose hash a
     stranger may already be verifying against. Rewriting them to say something
     else would break every pin that names them and would be this record editing
     what it already signed. The focus machine four rows down is kept whole for
     exactly this reason and states it in those words: a legacy document
     validates against the vocabulary it was authored under. So the word stays
     VALID and stops being REACHABLE — nothing in `edges` names it as a
     destination, which is what "removed from the state machine" means for a
     machine that cannot rewrite its own history. `legal` is what this machine
     produces; `legacy` is what it must still read.

     THE OUT-EDGES ARE KEPT for the same reason and only for it: a document
     already sitting at `published` must still be pickable-up, or the removal
     would strand every case ever published behind a state with no exit. Nothing
     new ever arrives there to use them.

     WHAT REPLACED THE STATE EVERYWHERE ELSE: the CASE RELATION. Every guard
     that read `current_state === 'published'` — cannot divide, cannot
     restructure, cannot move a version, the frozen/confirmed basis split,
     reopen's own gate — now asks whether the document's CURRENT VERSION is a
     case member, which CASE-5 made answerable by the pin (`bundle_sha =
     version_sha`). That is one question with one answer instead of a state word
     and a roster that could disagree, and it is also why CASE-4 needed no second
     mechanism to notice a revision: a revised member's head stops matching the
     pin, and that same inequality IS the revision flag.

     ============ The REC-14 / DEC-12 reasoning that put `published` here, kept
     because it is what the removal has to preserve. It was: reachable ONLY from
     `concluded` — a material set cannot be asserted over a question with no
     conclusion — and it leaves ONLY to `open` (and its `surfaced` alias), which
     is DEC-12's reopening: *"A closed finding can be reopened, and a published
     case can be revised, though when republished, the edition number must be
     incremented and the case treated as a separate document."*

     REOPENING DOES NOT UNPUBLISH, and this table is where that survives. The
     inquiry's STATE and its PUBLICATION HISTORY are two different records: the
     edges here move the working document, and published_bundles keeps every
     edition with its own signature, attestor, time and gate version forever.
     A revision therefore costs the full ceremony — published -> open ->
     concluded -> published at edition 2 — because each edition is a separate
     document that carries its own conclusion, its own falsifier and its own
     freshly authored completeness (C-21.1).

     DELIBERATELY NOT ADDED: `published -> deferred|dismissed`. Ageing is what
     happens to a finding NOBODY published (D-79); a published case cannot
     quietly stop being worked on, because it is already out in the world.
     `published -> published` is not an edge either: a new edition is entered
     through `open`, so the state_history a reader checks shows the reopening
     that produced it rather than a case that mutated in place. */
  /* REC-16 / DEC-28: `divided` joins, and it IS TERMINAL. It is a STATE and not
     a disposition, and the line between the two families is not terminality —
     `deferred` and `dismissed` are terminal-ish too — it is WHAT THE WORD
     CLAIMS ABOUT THE QUESTION. A disposition is a member's judgment about a
     well-formed question and the question survives it unchanged; `divided` says
     the QUESTION ITSELF was malformed, it was two questions, and the parent is
     corrected FORWARD into its children. That is DEC-19's shape and the
     supersession family, not the declination family. Its reason belongs to the
     ACT and `disposition_reason` is untouched.

     ENTERED FROM `open` (and its `surfaced` alias) AND FROM `concluded`, and
     NOT FROM `published` — inquiry's divide refuses that one BY NAME
     (PUBLISHED_CANNOT_DIVIDE) rather than as a generic illegal move, because
     the two are different statements: an EDITION says the case continues, a
     DIVISION says the parent was malformed, and a signed edition cannot be
     retroactively declared malformed without erasing what a reader relied on.
     DEC-12 changed publishing; it did not change this.

     DELIBERATELY NOT ADDED: `deferred|dismissed -> divided`. A question the
     group set DOWN is picked back up first (op=reopen), exactly as concluding
     one is — the machine already carries those edges, and dividing something
     nobody is working on would make the disposition a state nothing can be
     reasoned about from.

     TERMINAL, and structurally so rather than by policy: the parent's legs are
     OWNED by its children now, and un-dividing would be the record changing its
     mind in silence. `divided: []` is that fact, and it is what makes the
     children's `supersedes` edges the only forward path. */

     draft rather than on the way in.
     `proposed` is the ONLY state an INHALE could ever reach, and the reason it
     exists as a state of its own. DEC-54 (c): "INHALE MEANS PROPOSE FOR

     standard — 'we follow BBC standards' with nobody in the group having
     authored anything, which is the never-prefill violation wearing a
     compliance badge." A machine that could write `adopted` directly would BE
     that laundering, so the machine's ceiling is a state and not a convention.
     `adopted` is entered ONLY from `proposed`, and entering it is what
