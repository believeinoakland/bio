/* record-grammar: the one accepting act's record (R52; T41-1, N820; D3; K2405, K2418). Investigation §5: "One accepting
   act for every kind of proposal: a find, a hunch, a proposed question or step, or the reading of a passage. The member
   takes it up as proposed, takes it up edited, or writes her own instead, and the record keeps which." Every owner of an
   accepting act (`steps` R24, `hypotheses` R17, `run-productions` R22, `question-explorer` R6, `investigation` R12, R20,
   `case-authoring` R64) records this one shape, so "how often each kind is accepted unchanged" is one count over one
   field, group-wide (D3), and no owner spells the forms again.

   It refuses nothing on vouching grounds: which acts would make a member vouch for a legal or authored statement is
   each owner's, and that owner refuses `as_proposed` with `ACCEPT_MUST_REAUTHOR`, the one spelling held here. What it
   does refuse is a record that is not an acceptance at all: an unknown form, no proposal, no kind, no time, or no member
   (accepting is a member's act; a machine identity never accepts, R15). Pure: the caller stamps `at` (R24). */
