/* ===================================================================== *
 * THE MACHINE-IDENTITY PREDICATE (REC-46, out of REC-45's measurement).
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, measured through op=promote before it was written:
 * this plane had THREE unrelated ways of asking "is this a person" — the word
 * list above, the `token:` prefix `store.mjs` refused BY SHAPE, and
 * `ACTOR_CLASSES` — and NONE of them knew the whole answer. `checkGrounds`
 * asked only the word list, so `asserted_by: token:member` PASSED the
 * hand-written door while the identical claim was refused for saying `agent`.
 * A word list that a new class silently escapes is the shape to remove, not to
 * extend, so there is now ONE predicate and every asking site reads it.
 *
 * A SECOND MINTED SPELLING, found by sweeping for the class rather than
 * trusting the routed count of three: `index.mjs` stamps `token:<class>` on
 * AUTHORSHIP fields (author, actor, by) and `class:<class>` on OWNERSHIP and
 * viewer fields, at twenty sites between them. The word list knew neither.
 * Closing only the routed one would have left the same hole one spelling over.
 *
 * WHY THE MINT COMPOSES FROM HERE TOO. The prefixes are the CONTROL PLANE's
 * own vocabulary, and a refusal that reads one literal while the stamp writes
 * another is precisely the drift D-164 exists to stop. When this was written the
 * legacy index, store and query modules each imported it; today control-plane's
 * routes stamp and every refusing module imports this one, so the stamp and the
 * refusal are the same two strings and cannot disagree at all.
 *
 * TWO PREDICATES, AT TWO STRENGTHS, AND THE NARROWER ONE IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT.
 * `isMachineStamp` answers "did the control plane mint this identity", by
 * SHAPE. `isMachineIdentity` answers the full question and is `isMachineStamp`
 * OR a bare class word OR a surface/AI identity. `taskForward`/`taskResolve`
 * (REC-28, D-151) deliberately take the NARROW one: on those two verbs the
 * bare string "admin" is a LEGITIMATE actor — it is ROOT_ADMIN's own session —
 * so the bare-class arm would refuse the root administrator's browser. That
 * difference is real, it is documented at those two sites, and it is not
 * collapsed. Both still derive from the ONE set of prefixes, so moving what
 * counts as a minted machine identity moves those two sites as well.
 *
 * ABSENT IS NOT MACHINE. An empty or missing identity answers FALSE here and
 * every caller keeps its own `!who` arm, because "nobody said" and "a machine
 * said" are different findings and undetermined is first-class (CLAUDE.md).
 * ===================================================================== */
