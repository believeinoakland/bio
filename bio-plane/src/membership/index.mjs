/* membership — projects as working groups: their setup, participation, sight and the fence. Who the members are is
 * `member-roster`'s (T51, CR-4): each name whose requirement moved there is a delegate here, so no user re-points (K3268).
 *
 * Requirements: build/requirements/membership.md (R18, R31–R36, R38, R43–R45, R47, R54–R56, R60, R61, R65–R67, R69,
 * R71, R74–R78, R80, R85, R87, R88, R106, R112, R114–R118, R120, R122, R127, R128, R132, R133, R149–R151 and R154).
 * Design: docs/architecture/BIO_Membership_Architecture_v2.md.
 *
 * SHAPE (K61). `membershipOf(ctx)` answers the one instance for a Durable Object's storage, over `ctx.storage.sql`, and
 * reaches record-core by `recordOf(ctx)` on the same `ctx` (`bundleInfo`, `declarePurge`, …) and `member-roster` by
 * `membersOf(ctx)`; a test may pass its own record-core as `membershipOf(ctx, { record })`. This module's SQL joins
 * record-core's `bundles` only on the stated read contract, `bundle_id` and `object_type` (record-core R37), and reads
 * `members` only for `member_id`, `role` and `status` (`member-roster` R67); every other bundle fact (a project's title) is
 * asked of `core.bundleInfo` (R34).

   A machine credential (the four token classes and an organisation-scoped `ai` credential) sees every bundle; a
   `member:<id>` viewer sees every bundle that is not a project, and a project only as a participant (any state) or as
   an active administrator; any other viewer sees nothing (fail closed).
   The predicate is written over the alias `b`, bound to record-core's `bundles` (its R37 read contract). `member`
   is the viewer's member id, null for every arm that is not an identified session (D-310).
   N357 (K494, W1): the founder's viewer is spelled bare `admin` or `member:admin` (the founder's positional
   spelling, `resolveSession`'s identity); both see what the founder's arm admits, and only the second names a member,
   `admin`. The founder has no roster row; its participation rows, when it owns or joined a project, are `admin`'s.
   N426 (K704, K710): THE PROJECT FENCE. A bundle that belongs to a project (record-core R34's `project`, which promotion
   writes from the document) is seen exactly when its project is: so an escalation's, a plan's or any project record's
   bundle read record-wide is fenced by the same arms that fence the project itself. The project a row is judged
   by is its own id for a project, and its `project` column for anything else (an empty one names none).
   D54 (Bob's "D54: B", K2408; hidden projects only, K2409; T41-3): an administrator, the founder included, sees a HIDDEN
   project, and every bundle belonging to it, only as a participant (invited or joined); a DISCOVERABLE project stays
   seen whole by administrators. The setting is read from `project_sight` (R85's index, the owners' latest act), so a
   project the index does not hold, and a bundle naming a project that is not one, reads hidden: seen by its
   participants and machine credentials alone (fail closed). At a hidden project's EXISTENCE an administrator learns
   its id, name and owners and nothing else (R44, R77). */

   * REC-134 through the ops: several acts that change a project took the VISIBILITY gate as
   * their only barrier (or had none at all), and every administrator — enrolled, and since
   * IC-149 the founder — passes that gate for every project. So an administrator who was
   * never invited could revise a project's document, move its citation edges, move what it
   * stands on, record a judgement in its feed, and adopt a bias set into its scope.
   *
   * THE QUESTION IS ASKED OF WHO THE ACTOR IS, NEVER OF WHAT IT MAY SEE. `identity` is the
   * POSITIONAL half of the control plane's one session resolver (`resolveSession`, IC-149):
   * `member:<id>` for a signed-in session (the founder's is `member:admin`), a member-scoped
   * `ai` credential's principal, and `class:<cls>` for every instance credential. It is read
   * through `positionalMember`, the one place a viewer-shaped string becomes a member, so a
   * `class:*` credential answers null and is NOT ASKED — machine credentials hold no roster
   * position, and their fences are their own and unchanged (DEC-63's reasoning at the run
   * verbs, and the brief's). An ABSENT identity is also not asked: that is every internal
   * caller (`cite` promoting its own edit, `forkProject`, the version pointer's own write),
   * and the control plane stamps it on every enumerated act, deleted first so a caller can
   * never name one.
   *
   * WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH, and each is deliberate: §7.13's add-an-owner (`project-roster`'s `projectOwnerRescue`)
   * is the ONE administrator path and keeps its condition, its vote and its record — it never
   * calls this. The roster acts, publication, the review copy, the run verbs and the lead share

   *   second string to keep in step. IC-141's `#noCaseDocument` is the precedent, one object over.

  /* ===== D-497 — THE DERIVATION, AND IT IS THE ONLY PLACE THE RULE IS STATED (Membership v2 §7, item 7.14).
   *
   * WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR. `sight` was a JS predicate with no row source, so `projectDirectory` established
   * "this caller sees none of them" by asking it about every project in the group one at a time: each statement
   * bounded, the NUMBER of statements growing with the record. D-479 bounded what the directory PUBLISHES and
   * reported this half as a row of its own, in these words — *"bounding that needs a row source the sight
   * predicate itself READS, not a second copy of its rule"*. This is that row source.
   *
   * THE RULE, STATED ONCE: a project's setting is its OWNERS' LATEST ACT, and HIDDEN where they have never
   * acted — every project that existed before REC-149 (each created under §7.9's promise that the uninvited see
   * not its existence), every creation that carried no setting, and everything a machine created. It is the
   * CASE below and nowhere else. `visibilityOf` reads the answer; the directory joins the same table; nobody
   * restates the default. REC-149's first build DID restate it — its directory took candidates from the
   * visibility table — and its own `default-discoverable` control arm caught that by flipping the default and
   * watching the directory not move.
   *
   * DERIVED, NEVER AUTHORED. `project_visibility` stays the record: append-only, one row per owner's act. This
   * table is a projection of it that a statement can join, recomputed WHOLE at every boot (the `#seedMintLedger`
   * precedent) and per project wherever a project or an act changes — so a row that disagreed with the log,
   * for any reason including a landing that moved the rule, does not survive a restart.
   *
   * THE ROW IS project_id AND setting AND NOTHING ELSE, AND THAT IS THE FIX TO A DEFECT THIS LANDING'S OWN
   * FIRST DRAFT HAD. It carried a third column, `at`, a fresh timestamp written on every recompute — so an
   * UNCHANGED boot rewrote every row with different bytes, and A RESTART PLUS A PURE READ THEN MOVED A TABLE.
   * `versionnotice.test.mjs`'s no-write WITNESS caught it by name on the first full battery (`WITNESS QUIET`
   * and `NOTHING WRITTEN (the whole store)`, both naming `project_sight`): a live verification's no-write guarantee
   * rests on the record's tables reading the same before and after, so a derivation that writes on every boot
   * costs that guarantee.
   * Two narrower fixes were tried at the STATEMENT and BOTH ARE REFUSED BY WORKERD with
   * `Error: incomplete input: SQLITE_ERROR` — a `WHERE` on the conflict action, and the same guard moved into
   * a LEFT JOIN against the index — while `node:sqlite` prepares each of them without complaint, which is the
   * receipt for driving the plane's own engine rather than a local one. So the column went instead: a
   * projection needs no date of its own, the act log carries every date there is, and an unchanged recompute
   * now writes rows BYTE-IDENTICAL to the ones it found, and it costs nothing (`test/m/membership/t19-enrol-boot.test.mjs`
   * holds a second boot's index idempotent at the byte, R45 and R85).
   *
   * COST, STATED. Two statements. Given a projectId both address ONE row through a primary key and an indexed
   * lookup; given none, both run once over the projects in `bundles` — inside SQLite, nothing per row in JS,
   * at boot only, reached by no op. The work is inside SQL, so it is stated here rather than left for a reader of
   * this file's JS loops to miss. */
