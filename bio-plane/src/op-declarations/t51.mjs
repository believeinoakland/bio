/* op-declarations R77, R78, R79 (T51; DEC-330 owed, U348, K3810; K3826, K3829, K3839, K3843, K3852, K3853; N858, N1046,
   N1088, K3935, K3976, K4059): T51'S READS IN THE OWNERS' FAMILIES, held apart from `index.mjs` for size, as `t45.mjs` to
   `t50.mjs` hold the earlier tranches'. Each op is named under its owner with the kind `index.mjs`' `OP_KINDS` gives it,
   read from the owner's merged requirement and its ops map's arm. `index.mjs`' `family()` merges each share into its
   owner's family and builds each of `T51_FAMILIES` as it builds `T45_FAMILIES`. The kinds:
   - `read` (admin, member, probe; `NEEDS` `null`, `viewer` stamped): `bundlehistory` (promotion R58), `entityidonly`,
     `subjectsnamed`, `entitysimilar` (entities R57, R59, R60), `projectinvitations` (project-roster R35), `versioncompare`
     (basis-versions R55), `approvedunsent` (filings R53) and `checkpointsdue` (action-plans R17), the last two with no
     owner arm: the control plane's route serves them (screens-action R30; K3867); `heldat` (capture R96) is `read` too and
     is also stamped `by`, set from the session only (its R86 fence, `MEMBER_SESSION_REQUIRED`);
   - `sessionread` (a member's session only, `machineClasses: []`; classes admin, member, probe; `NEEDS` `null`, `viewer`
     stamped): `holdsdue` (action-holds R19), `templatebyhandle` (filing-templates R34), `rulefields` (local-facts R18)
     and `clocksrunning` (action-clocks R24);
   - `ownread` (a read for a session only, an administrator's, NOT_AN_ADMIN otherwise): `adminremovalsopen`
     (member-roster R75, served through membership's map, its R154), `by` stamped;
   - `public` (`classes: null`, nothing stamped, in no session set, no `NEEDS` row): `publishedfrozen` (public-read R38).
   `projectlist`'s `after` (project-roster R36) and the `scope` parameter of `searchfields`, `search` and `meaningrows`
   (retrieval R87) are request fields the door passes as given: they declare nothing, and R77's test pins that their
   specs are unchanged. `BROWSER_ACTS` (R76), the acts done in the browser alone, is the one table here that is no op's.
   This file is data only (R5, R7). */
