   shares, families and `REAUTH_ACTS` in `t47.mjs`, R55, R57–R59, R61; T48's shares and families in `t48.mjs`, R64, R66–R68;
   T49's shares in `t49.mjs`, R71, R72; the composition of `NEEDS` in `compose.mjs`, R3).
   Every op's spec, the act lists that drive the stamps and the fences, the
   session sets, the capability table (composed here, R3, from `op-capabilities`' hand-written rows and the families'),
   the recorded decisions that a verb is not a person's, and the act gate read
   from those tables. It declares; it judges no caller and routes nothing (`admission` and `control-plane` read it).
   Copied from `control-plane/ops.mjs` at the control-plane split (T18, K617, K624 (1), (2)), which control-plane's own
   job has since deleted; that file came from legacy-index at control-plane's extraction (T12, K3, K93). The handlers stay with
   their modules and only the declarations live here.
   R5: every table and list is FROZEN data, read as it is exported — the specs and their class lists, the arrays, the
   two session sets (each a `FrozenSet`, whose `add`, `delete` and `clear` refuse) and the two maps. Nothing here is
   computed from a request, a store or the environment, and nothing here reads one (R7).
   R69: and none is built when the module is evaluated: `build()` makes them all on the first read of any export (see
   the note above it, and the end of this file where each export is declared). */

/* T34 (R21; DEC-139 (5), K1565): THE REGISTRY'S REQUIREMENT FUNCTIONS UNDER THEIR OWN NAMES. The screen registry
   (`docs/development/ux-substrate/screens/registry.json`) marks an act `function` by its requirement function's name
   lowercased; where that name is not already an op, its owner serves the function under the op named here, and the
   alias is that op in every table — its spec, both session sets, its `NEEDS` row, every act list naming the op and its
   stamps — so the control plane routes the two to one handler and they answer alike (control-plane R55). Each was read
   at the owner's ops map. A function no op serves has no alias (R6).
   T35 (K1901): the registry is read as PR #12 left it. The person screen names `personexpunge` itself (DEC-142), so it
   is the declared op of people's family and no alias names `expunge`; an act marked `owed:<op>` whose op is declared
   here under that name (`placewanted`, `securitymap`, `findin`, …) is that op, with no alias made for it.
   T37 (R21; N776, DEC-182 (1), (4)): the registry is read as PR #14 left it (`e08cd35ecb`). It names no function that
   no op serves: `projectcreated`, `countask`, `registerproceeding` and `deadlinecompute` are withdrawn there (their
   buttons re-pointed to `promote`, `calculationcreate`, `entitycreate` and `clockpropose`, each a declared op), and
   `setpassword` is an owed act, declared under its own name in credentials' family (R39) beside `obscuremark` (R38),
   `subscriptionsignin` (R36) and the translation acts (R35, R37); `infolevelset` alone stays owed with no spec. The
   same-person claim is one op there, `identityclaim` (DEC-182 (2)): `claimidentity` is no registry function and no
   alias.
   T38 (R21, R40; N788, DEC-183): the registry is read as PR #15 left it (`c848b56671`): its owed act
   `obscuremarkwithdraw` (the ceremony's Photos step) is declared under its own name in case-carriage's family (R40),
   with no alias; `infolevelset` alone stays owed with no spec.
   T46 (R52; N937; DEC-194, DEC-197): the registry is read as PR #28 merged it (`main` at `3f40899950`). Its 80
   `function` acts name the functions above, the aliases among them; those new since PR #19 (`ailimitset`, `archivelist`,
   `startfrom`, …) are declared ops under their own names, so no alias is made, and `knock` is no longer a function act.
   Its owed acts are all declared here under their own names now — `itemtakeup`, `actionscope`, `filingsecondapprove`
   (R49), `subscriptionsignin` (R36), `projectaikeepaway` (R41), `infolevelset` (R50) and `escalationstoppursuing`

   modules serve, and every op T33 adds to an earlier module, is declared here once, in its owner's entry, and the entry
   is all that is spread below into `OPS`, both `SESSION_OPS` sets and `NEEDS` — so a family cannot be specced in one
   table and forgotten in another. An entry names each op's KIND (the spec and capability it takes) and the stamps the
   door sets on it: `viewer` on every op of every family (each owner answers by the caller's sight and fails closed
   without it) but T34's public doors and reads, which stamp only what their family names (R22), `actor` on each act and `proposer` on each proposal, each `{key, at}` — the parameter the owner reads
   and whether it reads it from the `query` or the `body`, because the owners differ (events, duties, following and
   credentials read `by` from the query; lines, money, workbooks, people and hypotheses from the body; standards reads
   `author` and `proposer` from the body; calculations and answers take the stamped `viewer` as their actor). The
   stamps themselves are the control plane's (`control-plane`'s arms, K1122): this table only says which.

   probe, `contribute`; an act its owner refuses a machine by name is `member` — a session's only (`machineClasses: []`),
   `contribute`; an administrator's own act (asked of the roster, NOT_AN_ADMIN) is `admin`, and a member's act on their
   own account, attention or ties is `own` — each a session's only and, on D-136's and `queuemute`'s reasoning, no
   working capability (`null`; since T37 also a member's act its owner gates by its own grant, not a capability: the
   interface's translation, R35, R37); a `proposal` is any credential's, an agent credential's by its scope (R2), labelled by
   its proposer, `contribute`; a `tally` writes a count in no one's name (`null`); a `read` is admin, member and probe

/* BIO plane, control plane entry (this note came with the table from `control-plane/ops.mjs`; the gates it names are
 * `admission`'s since the split: `classify`, `scopeFor`).
 *
 * Secret discipline, which is a design constraint rather than a convention:
 *
 *   1. No module reads a credential at import time. Every secret arrives as a
 *      binding on env, so the whole tree loads and the module tests run with
 *      no secrets present at all. That is what makes them credential-free by
 *      construction rather than by accident.
 *   2. R2 credentials never leave the Worker. The Worker holds the bucket as a
 *      BINDING, not as an access key, so there is no key to leak, rotate, or
 *      hand to anyone. Nothing outside Cloudflare ever signs an R2 request.
 *   3. Callers present a token whose CLASS bounds what it can do. A probe-class
 *      token can read and can touch only the scratch namespace. If it leaks it
 *      buys nothing.
 *
 * Token classes, extending the accelerator's tokenClass_ rather than replacing
 * it:
 *   admin   every op, including promotion against the live store
 *   member  read, lease, allocid, promote within the member's group
 *   probe   read-only ops, plus writes confined to the scratch namespace
 *   daemon  the UNATTENDED PATH, and nothing else: op=monitor and the archive
 *           arm of op=acquire, against the LIVE store. Not scratch-confined,
 *           because what it does is write the real record's reachability. See
 *           admission's `classify()` for DEC-37's reasoning and why it is named for the
 *           path rather than for either of its two consumers.
 *
 * There is deliberately no public class. A credential handed to the public is
 * not a credential: to be public it must be widely distributed, and once
 * distributed it bounds nothing. It bought two ops and cost one real defect,
 * because the class existing invited op=index onto its list while op=index reads
 * the working corpus (D-30). The public surface is protected STRUCTURALLY
 * instead, by the classes:null ops below, each of which enforces its own gate
 * and answers only from the published projection. Safety comes from WHERE an op
 * reads, not from who holds a token.

   that made DISPOSITIONS one array.

   THE `author` STAMP IS THE FIRST OF THE THREE LAYERS the fence around these
   acts is made of, and it is worth naming all three here because a reader
   meeting one of them will assume it is the whole thing:

     1. HERE — a machine credential is stamped `token:<class>` and a
        caller-supplied `author` is OVERWRITTEN, never honoured. Without this a
        machine could sign a member's name to the decision.
     2. THE ENDPOINT — `NEEDS` requires `contribute`, so a session that does not
        hold it is refused before the store is reached.
     3. THE TRANSITION — the store refuses a machine identity BY SHAPE through
        REC-46's one predicate (MACHINE_CANNOT_MOVE_VERSION).

   Each layer absorbs the others when it is whole, so each is proved where it
   lives, on its own: layer 2 by this module's R3 test
   (`test/m/op-declarations/tables.test.mjs`, the six acts riding `contribute`),
   layer 3 by basis-versions' tests (`test/m/basis-versions/acts.test.mjs`,
   MACHINE_CANNOT_MOVE_VERSION), layer 1 by the control plane's stamp.

   ONE ARRAY BECAUSE THEY ARE ONE LANDING.
   `BIO_Membership_Architecture_v2.md` §4.7 (BOB #17, 2026-09-19, read at the
   code) found these three reachable by NO session while §4.7 assigns the vote to
   a PERSON, and `by` stamped for `PROJECT_ACTIONS` alone — so on the one
   reachable path THE CALLER NAMED THE VOTER, and seven releases of governance
   arithmetic rested on an attribution the caller supplied.
   **EITHER HALF ALONE IS WORSE THAN NEITHER, which is why one array carries
   both.** Session reach without the stamp leaves the vote forgeable by whoever
   can name a voter; the stamp without reach makes the vote castable by NOBODY,
   because a bearer token would stamp as a machine and be refused with no session
   route to replace it. An array is what makes the two halves impossible to ship
   apart: it is spread into BOTH of `SESSION_OPS`' sets below, it is a disjunct
   of the `by` stamp's condition, and it is the operator fence's subject — so a
   later hand adding a fourth governance verb gets all three at once or none.
   Why BOTH sets rather than the admin one is argued at the spread itself, where
   a reader meets it: `SESSION_OPS.admin` means the FOUNDER'S session alone, and
   §4.7 gives these acts to every administrator.
   `membercaps` rides with the two votes rather than beside the roster ops:
   §4.9 makes setting capabilities a custodial act over MEMBERSHIP, §5 says an
   administrator's own field is not editable at all (4.4 defeated by arithmetic
   otherwise), and the store refuses that case by name. It is the same
   bearer-only state and the same fix.
   NOT `memberadd`/`memberset` — CORRECTED 2026-09-21 by REC-156, because only one
   of this sentence's three clauses was true. It read: *"they already hold session
   reach, they take their own `by` at the store, and widening this array to them
   would be a reach change wearing this item's costume."* `memberSet` takes NO `by`
   at all, and `memberadd`'s session reach is the FOUNDER'S alone (`SESSION_OPS.admin`
   — this block's own measurement). Its `by` WAS the caller's: the §4.7 forgery this
   array closed for three ops, alive in a fourth. REC-156 stamps it by its OWN
   disjunct on the `by` stamp, NOT by joining this array — and the reason is the
   clause that stays true: this array also spreads MEMBER-set reach and the operator
   fence, and moving either is a reach change and a refusal nobody ruled. The stamp
   site says what was decided about a bearer, and that it is provisional. */

   `SESSION_OPS.admin` alone — the FOUNDER'S password session — so an enrolled administrator was refused
   them with a sentence calling the op an administrator's, which she IS. D-136's call, applied again, in
   three halves that ship together or not at all:
     (1) REACH — spread into BOTH `SESSION_OPS` sets, and `member` in each OPS row's `classes`, because an
         enrolled administrator's `kind` is `member` however her roster row reads;
     (2) THE STAMP — a disjunct of the `by` stamp, so the SERVER names who acted, and the store's relays
         read `by` from the query over anything in the body;

         `#custodialBar` for `signeradd` and `signerset`) refuses a member-named `by` that is not an ACTIVE

   (progressiondefine) and READS one (progression). Named as one set in both the member
   and admin lists so the two cannot drift apart. The two WRITES are stamped with the
   declaring member below, like the registry and recogniser writes: a progression
   definition is a member's claim about how an institution ought to behave (framework
   §8.1), and who derived a connection is part of the record. The reads take no viewer
   stamp — they key on an entity id, a capture sha and a progression key.
   CONSTRUCTS Step 5, SLICE B (FW-9) extends the set: a member THREADS real documents into a
   progression instance (thread — stamped with the threading member below, like the writes
   above) and READS the instance (instance — no viewer stamp, keyed on progression key and
   entity id). Named here so the member and admin lists cannot drift apart.
   CONSTRUCTS Step 5, SLICE C (FW-10) extends it again: a member DISCHARGES a lawful skip by
   recording an exception document (discharge — stamped with the declaring member below) and
   READS the raw discharges (exceptions — no viewer stamp, keyed on progression key + entity id).
   REC-6 extends it once more with a READ: `proposals` is the DISCOVERY feed — a read-time walk of
   every progression instance for its missing-predecessor findings, D-79-aggregated. Ungated like
   the other progression reads (no viewer stamp, keys on nothing — it enumerates the whole record's
   derived questions), named here so the member and admin lists cannot drift apart.
   REC-7 adds a WRITE: `proposedispose` records a member's DEFER/DISMISS of a derived proposal
   (stamped with the deciding member below, like the other progression writes) — WITHOUT minting a
   bundle (D-79: declining is not authoring). op=proposals then ages the disposed proposal out of
   the open feed. Named here so the member and admin lists cannot drift apart.
   REC-9 adds a READ: `captureprogressions` is the per-document lookup — it maps a CAPTURE back to the
   progression instances it is threaded into, its stage in each, and each instance's missing-predecessor
   + overdue-successor findings (the same ONE derivation op=proposals reads, keyed by capture). Ungated
   like the other progression reads, named here so the two lists cannot drift apart.
   REC-65 / DEC-52 CORRECTS THE ACTOR IN EVERY SENTENCE ABOVE, and it is one correction rather
   than five: where this block says a MEMBER authors a progression definition, threads an instance
   or discharges a skip, read *a member OR a machine credential*. Bob ruled 2026-08-07 that the
   machine may rule; nothing here ever refused one, and DEC-52 settles that the CODE was right and
   this prose was wrong. Who acted is recorded either way — `class:<cls>` for a machine, never a
   person's name — so the two remain distinguishable claims. The full reasoning, and the four
   things the ruling carries with it, are at the FW-6 stamp site in the request path; it is not
   restated here, because a ruling copied into two files is a ruling that will disagree with
   itself. `proposedispose` is the EXCEPTION and is NOT covered — see its own site. */

                      TO — AND THAT IS WHY THE THREE ARE IN **BOTH** SETS, WHICH IS THE ONE
                      DESIGN CALL THIS ITEM HAD TO MAKE. It is `EXPERTISE_ACTIONS`' posture,
                      written out at that array with its reasoning, and the reasoning is the
                      same here.
                      **THE MEASUREMENT THAT FORCED IT.** `kind` is
                      `sess.role === "admin" ? "admin" : "member"`, so `SESSION_OPS.admin`
                      does NOT mean *an administrator's session*: it means THE FOUNDER'S
                      PASSWORD SESSION AND NOTHING ELSE. An enrolled administrator holds
                      `member:<id>` however their roster row reads — found by D-270, where
                      two separate harnesses made exactly that mistake and measured a split
                      of zero over a plane that had one; admission's tests
                      (`test/m/admission/admission.test.mjs`) now prove the founder's set is
                      the founder's session alone. So `...GOVERNANCE_ACTIONS` in the ADMIN SET ALONE would have
                      given the §4.7 vote to ONE person, the founder, while the operator
                      fence below took the bearer route away from everybody else — and §4.7
                      needs *the consensus of all existing administrators*. A group of three
                      would have been left unable to add or remove an administrator at all.
                      **That is the row's own failure mode, not an improvement on it:**
                      "stamping without reach makes the 4.7 vote unreachable by anybody",
                      arrived at one administrator instead of zero.
                      **WHAT DECIDES THESE ACTS IS THE ROSTER, AND THE STORE ASKS IT.** Both
                      sets reach the op; the `by` stamp below names whoever is signed in;
                      and `adminEndorse`, `adminRemove` and `memberCaps` each refuse a `by`
                      that is not an ACTIVE ADMINISTRATOR, by name. An ordinary member
                      therefore gets NOT_AN_ADMIN — which says what is actually wrong —
                      rather than "only an administrator's session", which would be true of
                      neither the caller nor the rule, and which every real administrator
                      would have received too. `expertiseconfirm` is in the member set for
                      that sentence exactly, and `conclude`'s fail-closed posture is the
                      same argument: reach the handler, be refused by the thing that knows.
                      IT WIDENS NOTHING A MEMBER COULD NOT ALREADY SEE: `op=memberlist` is
                      admin/member/probe and already publishes the roster with its roles, so
                      no arm of these three discloses anything new before refusing.
                      Before this landing the three were in NEITHER set, so every session
                      got SESSION_ROUTE_NOT_RECORDED: an OMISSION honestly stated (D-270

   T44 (R47; DEC-191; K2732): the registry as PR #25 left it marks `pagetranscribe` a served act, owed no longer; its
   text stays `ACT_HELP`'s under the op (affordances R48), so it is named under no ground here.
   T45 (R34, R49): every member op T45 declares (`t45.mjs`) is named here until the design stream gives its text — the
   reads under the read ground (the assistant's two drafts among them, no screen's control yet), the acts
   under the last.
   T46 (R34, R50, R51, R53; K2996, K2999): the ops whose text `mock-acts.js` lacks are named — `infolevel`,
   `statusreportassist`, `joindoors` and `clockproposals` under the read ground, the member-run door's `airundispatch`
   under the last; `infolevelset`, `escalationstoppursuing`, `escalationreopen` and `textcheck` are explained by
   `ACT_HELP` under their own names (affordances R53), and `handlechange` by the refusal sentence affordances R53 holds
   for it, so none of the five is named. T46 (R34, R49; K3005): affordances R53 re-generates `ACT_HELP` from PR #28's
   `mock-acts.js`, which explains 39 of T45's member ops; they leave the read and last grounds, so no op is both.
   T47 (R34, R54–R56, R59, R61; K3041): read against `ACT_HELP` as it stands before affordances' T47 job (T47-49)
   re-generates it from PR #33's `mock-acts.js`: the member ops T47 declares with no text there are named — the reads
   `sourceof`, `sourcerung`, `projectlist`, `projectquestions`, `peopledirectory` and `signintrace` under the read ground,
   the acts `drawquestion`, `projectbarset`, `monitorset`, `unlock`, `reauth`, `passwordresetlink`, `grouplogoset`,
   `grouplanguagesset` and `signrequest` under the last; the four publication ops K3041 brings into the session sets
   (`statementack`, `reviewcomment`, `publishpreflight`, `publishtensions`) are explained there already.
   T47 (R34, R54, R56; K3152): re-pinned against `ACT_HELP` as affordances' T47 job merged it from PR #33's
   `mock-acts.js`: the ops it now explains leave every ground (among them `projectlist`, `projectquestions`,
   `drawquestion`, `projectbarset`, `monitorset`, `unlock`, `passwordresetlink`, `grouplogoset`, `grouplanguagesset`,
   `signrequest`, `statusreportassist`, `airundispatch`, `joindoors`, `clockproposals`, `captureupload`, `ask`,
   `signout`); `capture`, whose text the design withdrew with its control (the capture screen names `captureupload`,
   R54), joins the no-control ground.
   T48 (R34, R64, R66, R67): the ops T48 declares with no text in `ACT_HELP` are named — the reads `aiuseovertime`,
   `exploregraph`, `filingread`, `pressurefor`, `proceedingdates`, `standardproposals` and `updatenotice` under the read ground;
   `lookedsince`, a mark Home records of itself with no control, under the no-control ground; the acts `actionreplyquoting`, `planask`,
   `readtranslate`, `stepsource` and `stepsourcewithdraw` under the last. `updatestart`, `updatelater` and `updateskip`
   are explained by `ACT_HELP` under their own names once `affordances` re-generates it from PR #34's `mock-acts.js`
   (R66); they are named under the last ground only while it lacks them, never both. */
