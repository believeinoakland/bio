/* calculations — numbers a finding can rest on (requirements: `build/requirements/calculations.md`; T33-41; K1447,
 * K1448, K1468, K1471, K1491). A calculation (`CALC-`) is computed only by `calc-grammar`'s closed recipe grammar
 * (`bio-calc/1`) over declared canonical tables, money facts, cited figures and counts over the record, with its
 * denominators, grade facts and method, stored under its result key and recomputed at acceptance, at publication and
 * in the checker, never on a read (R8). It holds the tables (R1–R3), the money ingest writer (R14), the recorded draw
 * (R18) with the spot-check visits to its items and the estimate over them (R38–R40), fact-based rankings (R17), the patterns of application a member measures (R32–R37, `./application.mjs`:
 * never the machine's, never "Noticed") and the machine's patterns (R22, R23, `./patterns.mjs`), held in the hypothesis
 * layer and shown only after a measured false-alarm rate. A total is a `CALC-` and is never re-entered as a money fact
 * (R13); `compare` yields a labelled computed fact, never a verdict (R5, R27).
 *
 * REACHED as `calculationsOf(host, deps)`: one instance per host, created on the first call with `deps`. At creation
 * it creates its tables, declares them (R29) and registers with the upstream modules `deps` names (R11, R19, R20).
 * `deps`:
 *   record, membership, content, provenance   the modules it uses directly, through their factories on the same host
 *                unless a test passes its own.
 *   money, duties, people, events, progressions, standards, entities, retrieval   the layer-5 modules it reads and
 *                registers with, each an object or a function answering one (reached lazily; absent ones answer
 *                undetermined where a read needs them). They are reached through `deps`, never imported, so this
 *                module reads them only through their public services.
 *                Since T35: `events.usesOf` and `readEvent` (R32's frozen uses and their sight), `standards`' `standardRead`,
 *                `inForceAt`, `isMeasure(id, viewer)`, `bindsAt` and `forcesOf` (R34–R36), and `entities.readEntity` (R32's kinds).
 *   registry     `connection-grammar`'s registry (default: the one the plane wires): the owners' `neighbours`, one hop,
 *                for R32's relationships, passed this module's host.
 *   combine      `jurisdictions.combine` (default): the active profiles' view, for fiscal periods, business days and
 *                id spaces.
 *   now          the module's clock, an ISO instant (default: the wall clock).
 *
 * No place is named here (R28): fiscal years, zones, closures and id spaces are profile data. No refusal here has a
 * catalogue row yet (T34 stamps T33's new rows): each answers `{ok: false, reason, detail}`. */
