/* case-authoring — preparing a case before anything is signed (requirements: `build/requirements/case-authoring.md`;
 * BIO_Publication_v0_1.md §3 rules 4, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, §6A). The owner of a project prepares a case: which concluded
 * findings it rests on and in what role, what it covers and excludes, who wrote its statement, what was searched and
 * with what outcome, and what bias it acknowledges. This module judges that preparation (`op=publish`), authors the
 * case document's text from the record and the owner's words (`./document.mjs`), and stores it unsigned through
 * `publication` (its R21). What other acts record about a case before its next edition (the statement's
 * acknowledgements and who wrote the statement, the drafts of what changed, the open requests for comment at signing,
 * the outcomes carried into a next edition) is `case-inputs`', which `publishCase` and `publishPreflight` ask (R14, R34,
 * R38, R74; N908, K2982); this module holds no table. What the case discloses about what it rests on
 * (tensions, grades and co-attestation, sources, materials, accepted work and flags, grading facts, hunch debt) is
 * judged and spelled by `case-disclosures`, which `publishCase` asks in R55's order (N529, K1333). (T41; D56, D57, D60,
 * D61, D63) It writes the case's account and the reviewers' comments the publisher chose into the document (R63), holds
 * the fields a case may carry and no other (R65), the pre-flight's account step (R67) and the approvals the group's rule
 * requires (R68). The account's own machinery (the system's drafts of it, its shape, its judgment against what it cites,
 * a draft's acceptance, the review comments' reader) is `case-account`'s, which `publishCase` asks in R69's order (N839,
 * K2608); its drafts' proposal and list and the reader's registration are `case-account`'s alone, and this module
 * answers none of them (R69; T43, N850).
 *
 * Extracted from the legacy modules (T8, layer 8; K3, K6, K57, K61, K82 (5), K94, K102): `store.mjs` (`publishCase`,
 * `#caseCitations`, `#caseDocumentText`, `#searchedForCase` with its two evidence probes, `COMPLETENESS_MAX`,
 * `MEMBER_ROLES`, `SEARCHED_SUBJECT_MAX`, the dispatch entry `publishcase`), `airun.mjs` (`searchedSection`,
 * `SEARCHED_LEVEL_OUTCOMES`, now `./searched.mjs`; N138) and the check catalogue (C-44.1, C-44.3–C-44.5, now
 * `./checks.mjs`). The acknowledgements, their table and C-82 moved on to `case-inputs` (T47; N908). The legacy code's
 * comments moved with it, shortened where they only restated the code.
 * The record's grammar (front matter, object types, grades, the machine predicate, the hash) is `record-grammar`'s;
 * the one front-matter spelling (`fmSafe`) is `case-grammar`'s (N424).
 *
 * WHAT IS AUTHORED AND WHAT IS STAMPED (R22, R25). Authored, caller-supplied and never prefilled: the scope, the
 * completeness statement, every exclusion row, the subject position with its justification (DEC-13), the bias
 * acknowledgement (DEC-46), the load-bearing partition (DEC-72 clause 4). Stamped or read from the record at the act:
 * the author (the control plane's stamp), the time, the case edition (from the published record, never a parameter),
 * each member's pin, own edition and frozen pair, the conclusion it rests on, the bar, the bias manifest, the
 * citations, the searched section, and the acknowledgements and the statement's writer (`case-inputs` R2, R3). Nothing is composed, summarised or
 * inferred, and no answer or document composes a case-level strength (R24, DEC-44).
 *
 * PUBLISHING WRITES NOTHING ON A MEMBER FINDING (R13, R23; D-442, rule 12): each member is pinned at the `bundle_sha`
 * it has as prepared, so one project's preparation never moves another project's pin.
 *
 * REACHED as `caseAuthoringOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host (the Durable Object's `ctx`), created on the
 * first call with `deps`, returned to every later caller. It holds no table and declares none. At creation it creates
 * `case-account`'s and `case-inputs`' one instances on the host, so those modules' tables exist and are declared at
 * every boot (case-account R12, case-inputs R16; the map's doubt 4). It registers with nothing (map §6 item 4); `review`
 * registers its comments' reader with `case-account` itself (its R7; N850).
 * `deps` (each reached through its factory on the same host unless given; a test passes its own):
 *   record, membership   layer 2: `readFile`, `head`, `transact`, `mintOpaqueId`; `viewerPredicate`,
 *                        `isProjectOwner`, `existenceAct`.
 *   inquiry              the basis read of R17's searched section.
 *   basisVersions        `testimonyReach` (R14's attributions).
 *   strength             `strengthOf`, `projectBar` (R6, R14).
 *   bias                 `biasManifest` (R14).
 *   observations         observation-log's `missingCauseAt` (R17).
 *   reevaluation         `raise` (R15).
 *   publishSchedule      `waitingEditionOf` (publish-schedule R7; R58; N823).
 *   account              `case-account` (N839, K2608): the account's shape, its draft, its judgment, the review
 *                        comments chosen and a draft's acceptance (its R4–R7), asked in R69's order: its one instance on
 *                        this host.
 *   inputs               `case-inputs` (N908, K2982): `statementWriter`, `statementAcknowledgements`,
 *                        `whatChangedDraftOf`, `pendingOutcomes`, `openRequestsOn` (its R2, R3, R7–R9): its one instance
 *                        on this host.
 *   publication          `storeCaseDocument`, `reviewProvider` (its R21, R23),
 *                        `criteriaFor` (its R75; R61).
 *   caseTensions         `caseRelation`, `attributionStatements` (case-tensions R1, R5; T33-62).
 *   calculations, workbooks   R56's gather (calculations R8–R10, workbooks R2). events   R57's timeline (its R28–R30).
 *   ratification         `caseConclusionFor`, `editionsRecordingConclusion` (its R1).
 *   networkNotices       `noticeReferenceOf` (its R19; R41, R42: DEC-111).
 *   disclosures          `case-disclosures` (N529, K1333): what a case discloses about what it rests on, asked in R55's
 *                        order: its one instance on this host, which the composition builds with the dependencies it
 *                        reads (N536); this module hands it none and reads none of them itself.
 *   now                  the clock for the instants it writes, `(precision) => ISO string` (default: the wall clock).
 * `case-checker`'s `checkStandardsUse` (its R21; R61) is pure and imported, never a dependency.
 *
 * READ CONTRACTS it joins in its own SQL, each named at its statement: record-core's `bundles` (R37); publication's
 * `cases`, `published_cases`, `published_case_members`, `published_bundles`, `case_documents` (R40); inquiry's `inquiry_basis` (R40); content's `content` (R45); provenance's `register` and
 * `captured_locators` (R48); extraction's `readings` (R58); observation-log's `observation_log` (R29). */
