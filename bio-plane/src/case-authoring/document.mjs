/* The case document's text (requirements: `build/requirements/case-authoring.md`, R14, R16, R17, R22, R26, R60). Pure:
 * nothing here touches a table, so a suite can render a document without a store and the gate can be run against bytes
 * this file produced. Moved from `store.mjs` (`#caseDocumentText`, `CASE_CITATION_WORDS`; `#fmSafe` is case-grammar's
 * since N424); the comments moved with them, shortened where they only restated the code. The acknowledgement list's
 * two renderings, `statementSha` and `withheldWriterStated` moved on to `case-inputs` (its R2; T47, N908).
 *
 * THE DOCUMENT IS A DOCUMENT RATHER THAN A SERIALISATION (CASE-5b / DEC-72). The frontmatter is what the gate and the
 * ratify committer read; the BODY is what a person reads, under canonical headings, because what is signed must be a
 * thing a member actually reviewed, and a member cannot review a block of key-value pairs they have to decode. Every
 * authored sentence appears in the body in the words it was authored in.
 *
 * THE GRAMMAR IS THE RESTRICTED FRONTMATTER GRAMMAR: scalars, a map of scalars, or an array of flat objects, never a
 * map holding an array. Hence `completeness` beside `completeness_excluded`, `searched` beside `searched_levels`,
 * `bias_manifest` beside `bias_manifest_bundles`. */
