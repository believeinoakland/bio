/* The three OpenDocument registry entries (I7, QUEUE COFF-10) — `.odt`,
 * `.ods`, `.odp` — built on COFF-9's ODF flavour row in `ooxml.mjs` and
 * emitting the SAME I2 shape and DEC-5 evidentiary envelope the OOXML sibling
 * of the same kind produces.
 *
 * WHY THEY ARE HERE AT ALL. COFF-6 measured ZERO native ODF assets in 43,282
 * oaklandca.gov keys and ruled DO NOT BUILD. That measurement is UNREVISED
 * and still true of native ODF in the wild. What changed is the SOURCE: Bob
 * ruled on 2026-09-14 that a Google Drive link KEEPS THE LINK and the harvest
 * is the OpenDocument EXPORT, which makes ODF the HARVEST format rather than
 * a published one. CAP-8 builds the capture side; without these entries the
 * export would be a document HELD and never READ, which is exactly the
 * document-is-not-the-answer failure `CLAUDE.md` names.
 *
 * WHY ONE MODULE FOR THREE FORMATS, and it is not a shortcut. OOXML is three
 * containers with three part maps — `word/document.xml`, `xl/workbook.xml` +
 * n worksheets, `ppt/presentation.xml` + n slides + n notesSlides — so
 * `docx.mjs`, `formats-xlsx.mjs` and `pptx.mjs` are three container walks.
 * OpenDocument is ONE container walk: `mimetype` says which document kind it
 * is and `content.xml` carries the WHOLE document — body, sheets, slides,
 * speaker notes, tracked changes, annotations and the automatic styles that
 * declare hiddenness, all in one part. The three entries therefore share one
 * `odfParts()` and differ only in the PROJECTION they take of it. Splitting
 * that into three files would triplicate the container walk to keep the
 * filenames tidy.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT EACH ENTRY EMITS, and the sibling whose shape it lands in
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   .odt  → `docx.mjs`'s shape.  structure(): {ok, container:"odt",
 *           paragraphs:<int>, links, counts, evidentiary, notes};
 *           text(): {ok, container:"odt", document, paragraphs:[{para, ref,
 *           text}], undetermined, counts:{chars, undetermined}}.
 *           Element references are IC-1's `doc-para`, built by IMPORTING
 *           `docParaRef` from `docx.mjs` — not re-derived here.
 *
 *   .ods  → `formats-xlsx.mjs`'s shape.  structure(): {ok, container:"ods",
 *           sheets:[{sheet, name, sheetId, state, hidden}], links, counts,
 *           evidentiary, notes};
 *           text(): {ok, container:"ods", document, sheets:[{sheet, name,
 *           hidden, text, undetermined, cells}], rangeUnits, rangeUnitsSkipped,
 *           undetermined, counts:{chars, cells, formulas, undetermined}}.
 *           Element references are IC-1's `sheet-cell` and `sheet-range`,
 *           built by IMPORTING `sheetCellRef`, `usedSheetRange` and
 *           `rangeUnitFor` from `formats-xlsx.mjs`.
 *
 *   .odp  → `pptx.mjs`'s shape.  structure(): {ok, container:"odp",
 *           slides:<int>, links, counts, evidentiary, notes};
 *           text(): {ok, container:"odp", document, slides:[{slide, ref,
 *           part, hidden, shapes, text}], speakerNotes:[{slide, ref, part,
 *           hidden, text}], deckLength:<int|null> (COFF-13; null when the
 *           body was not read), undetermined, counts:{chars, notesChars,
 *           undetermined}}.
 *           Element references are IC-1's `slide-shape`, built by IMPORTING
 *           `slideShapeRef` from `pptx.mjs`.
 *
 *   All three structure()s and text()s also carry `active` (R47), the one
 *   list of what can act when the file is opened, in `office-readers` R32's
 *   shape (`activeOf`).
 *
 * NO NEW IC-1 UNION MEMBER WAS NEEDED and none is invented: an OpenDocument
 * text document has paragraphs, a spreadsheet has cells, a presentation has
 * slides and shapes, and those are precisely the three arms IC-1 resolved.
 * I7 is therefore CONFIRMED by three more entries in the existing shape, not
 * changed.
 *
 * Link partitions come from the ONE `linkWrapper` imported from
 * `subresources.mjs` — the same parity pin `pdfstructure.mjs`, `docx.mjs`,
 * `formats-xlsx.mjs` and `pptx.mjs` all make, so FRAMEWORK consumes an
 * OpenDocument export through the identical code path as an HTML page.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE DEC-5 EVIDENTIARY EXTRAS: WHAT `content.xml` CARRIES, AND WHAT IT
 * CANNOT — STATED PER ENTRY RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE INFERRED FROM SILENCE
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This is the part that matters most, because the failure mode here is not a
 * crash: it is a consumer reading an ABSENT envelope item as a fact about the
 * DOCUMENT. `CLAUDE.md`'s sparse-at-every-level rule says absence at one
 * level is never evidence of absence at the next, so every extra this entry
 * does not read is carried as a NAMED `undetermined` in the envelope rather
 * than simply not emitted.
 *
 * MEASURED against real LibreOffice 26.8.0.3 output on 2026-09-14
 * (MEASUREMENTS.md), not read off the spec:
 *
 *   CARRIED BY content.xml, and emitted:
 *     .odt  tracked changes — `<text:tracked-changes>` holds each region's
 *           `<office:change-info>` (author, date) and, for a deletion, the
 *           SUPERSEDED WORDING itself; the body carries `<text:change-start>`
 *           / `<text:change-end>` / `<text:change>` marks that locate it to a
 *           paragraph. Exactly the docx `tracked-change` item, same kind name.
 *     .odt  comments — ODF's `<office:annotation>`, inline in the paragraph
 *           it annotates, with `<dc:creator>` and `<dc:date>`. Emitted as the
 *           same `comment` kind docx emits.
 *     .ods  formulas BESIDE cached values — `table:formula` on the cell,
 *           carried VERBATIM including OpenFormula's `of:` prefix, beside the
 *           displayed value as two named fields on one item. Never collapsed,
 *           never substituted into the text stream.
 *     .ods  hidden sheets — a table whose style declares
 *           `table:display="false"`. The style is in content.xml's own
 *           `<office:automatic-styles>`, so this IS readable from the one
 *           part. VERIFIED on real output: LibreOffice writes the flag on the
 *           table's STYLE, never on the `<table:table>` element; both are
 *           read, because a producer may do either.
 *     .ods  hidden rows and columns — `table:visibility="collapse"|"filter"`.
 *     .odp  SPEAKER NOTES — `<presentation:notes>` nested inside the page.
 *           Emitted as pptx's `speaker-notes` kind, kept OUT of `document`
 *           and counted apart, so no indexer can conflate them with slide
 *           text.
 *     .odp  hidden slides — `presentation:visibility="hidden"`, on the page's
 *           drawing-page style in automatic styles (where LibreOffice writes
 *           it) or on the page element. Extracted in full and FLAGGED.
 *
 *   NOT CARRIED BY content.xml, and READ FROM THEIR OWN PARTS (D-346,
 *   2026-09-25 — until then each was stated in `evidentiary.undetermined` as
 *   `outside_content_xml_not_read`, and both markers are gone because both
 *   parts are now read):
 *     core-properties (creator, title, created/modified, revision) live in
 *           `meta.xml`. Emitted as the SAME `core-properties` item, with the
 *           SAME fields and no others, that the OOXML entries build from
 *           `docProps/core.xml` — mapped by MEANING, not by element name,
 *           because ODF's `dc:creator` is the last editor (`parseOdfMeta`).
 *           A package WITHOUT meta.xml (OpenDocument permits it) is stated as
 *           `{part:"meta.xml", why:"part_absent"}`, so a missing item is
 *           never read as "this document has no author".
 *     embedded members (`Object 1/…`, an OLE blob, `ObjectReplacements/`)
 *           are listed in `META-INF/manifest.xml`, walked, and content-
 *           addressed into `intra` by sha256 exactly as the OOXML entries
 *           address `embeddings/`. Images under `Pictures/` are `text()`'s
 *           IC-124 `images`, not `intra` (`manifestIntraLinks` states the
 *           rule and what it cannot see).
 *
 *   DOES NOT EXIST IN OPENDOCUMENT AT ALL, as distinct from not read:
 *     a sheet's numeric id (xlsx's `sheetId`) — ODF identifies a table by
 *           name only, so `sheetId` is null and that null is the format
 *           speaking, not this reader.
 *     "veryHidden" — ODF's table visibility is a boolean, so `state` is
 *           "visible" or "hidden" and never xlsx's third value.
 *     a run index on a `doc-para` reference — `<text:span>` is a formatting
 *           artifact exactly as `<w:r>` is, but it is NOT the same unit, and
 *           emitting a span index under the field docx fills with a run index
 *           would assert a correspondence nothing established. References
 *           from these entries carry `para` and stop there (IC-1 makes `run`
 *           optional for precisely this reason).
 *
 * THE DETECT LADDER is the siblings' ladder, with ONE difference forced by
 * the format and named where it is made (see `detectOdf`): the OOXML entries
 * answer "likely" from part NAMES because their discriminating declaration is
 * deflated out of a synchronous detect's reach. ODF's discriminating
 * declaration — the `mimetype` member — is required by OpenDocument 1.2 part
 * 3 §3.3 to be FIRST and STORED, so it is reachable synchronously, and the
 * entries answer from the VALUE. Reading part names alone would be worse than
 * imprecise here: all three flavours have identical part names, so a
 * names-only ladder would make the first-registered entry claim every
 * OpenDocument package.
 *
 * THE SIZE BOUND is COFF-6's measured metric enacted in `ooxml.mjs`: 20 MiB
 * of DECLARED UNCOMPRESSED text-part bytes, summed from the central directory
 * BEFORE inflation. For ODF the text part is `content.xml` alone. Over the
 * bound the container walk and discrimination still run and text extraction
 * is refused as a STATED text-undetermined carrying the guard's own marker
 * verbatim (with its size, and `final: true`: R35 reads the other four
 * formats' text in pieces, and ODF is the one it does not, K4489) — the
 * docx.mjs pattern, never a silent truncation. Under it, the
 * REPEATS content.xml compresses are expanded within a second bound,
 * `ODF_REPEAT_EXPANSION_MAX` (R45; see the meter below), and a read that
 * would cross it is answered the same way with its own marker.
 *
 * FIX ROUND 9 (T51; R49–R55), in one place:
 *   - every part read for text (`content.xml`, `meta.xml`, `styles.xml`, the manifest) goes through one reader
 *     (`readXmlText`): decoded by ooxml's `decodeText` (R54), checked
 *     for a character reference that names no scalar value (R51: the part is stated unreadable, final), and made linear to
 *     walk (R52: one scan that turns any unclosed opener, or a tag over 64 KiB, into text, so no walk meets a token that
 *     never ends and no hostile run costs more than one scan);
 *   - a sheet is read a row at a time (`sheetRows`), in windows of tokens between which `yieldNow` is awaited (R49): the
 *     cells are listed only while their JSON is within `inlineCellsMax`, `cellsIn` makes any range from the same walk;
 *   - a covered table cell advances its column (R50); an annotation, a footnote, an endnote and a text box inside a
 *     paragraph are units of their own, with their kind, in `parts` (R53), and so are the master pages of `styles.xml`.
 *
 * This module ASSERTS nothing about meaning (FRAMEWORK's, through I2) and
 * WRITES nothing. Never invent structure: everything unreadable is stated.

/* WHY A SECOND BOUND. COFF-6's guard bounds the BYTES of content.xml, but ODF
 * compresses runs: `table:number-columns-repeated`, `table:number-rows-
 * repeated` and `<text:s text:c>` each make one short element stand for many.
 * Expanded without a bound, a few hundred bytes hang the reader or end in
 * `reader_failed:RangeError` (`text:c="2000000000"`). So every expansion is
 * paid for, before it is made, from a meter one `content.xml` read owns:
 *   - one unit per cell given at one address (a carrying cell's column repeat
 *     times its row's repeat), and one per link a repeated address carries
 *     after the cell's first (the link at the first address is literal markup);
 *   - one unit per hidden row range listed (R16);
 *   - one unit per space a `<text:s text:c>` stands for, each time the text
 *     holding it is given;
 *   - and, apart from the units, the CHARACTERS a repeat copies: a repeated
 *     cell's text at each address after its first counts against COFF-6's own
 *     figure, so repeats produce no more text than the byte bound admits
 *     written out (the parity BOB's measurement rests on; J2).
 * An empty run advanced over, and a figure that only accumulates (R12's
 * rows/cols, R18's used extent), costs nothing. Past either bound the read
 * stops and the entry answers as over the size guard, with its own marker.
 *
 * THE CAP IS MEASURED (build/plan/draft-T13-wordings.md §5, in git history):
 * 262,144 = 2^18 sits between the literal carrying cells the 20 MiB bound
 * admits (338,250 numeric, 255,750 string), and `text()` at that many units

 *  ciphertext, and a hash of them would address nothing a reader holds), and
 *  one that will not inflate — each an `undetermined` link naming it.
 *
 *  WHAT IT CANNOT SEE: a container member the manifest does NOT list
 *  (OpenDocument requires the listing; a non-conforming producer can omit
 *  one); a font face named only from styles.xml, which is not read, and any
 *  font face when content.xml was not read (over the bound) — those are

/* ==================================================================
 * D-351 — THE EVIDENTIARY DIGEST OF AN OPENDOCUMENT PACKAGE, taken over
 * the CONTAINER'S substance member and never over the envelope
 * ================================================================== */

/* WHY THIS EXISTS. A Google Drive export is Google's conversion AT FETCH
 * TIME, and its ZIP envelope differs on every request (timestamps, member
 * order — MEASUREMENTS.md 2026-09-14 §4). So `capture_sha`, the trust root,
 * differs across three fetches of a document that did not change, and C-18.3's
 * corroboration fold and monitoring's "has the substance changed?" both lost
 * the document. `capture_sha` STAYS the envelope's: this digest is the §5
 * `evidentiary` digest beside it (BIO_Content_Framework_v0_10.md §5;
 * DOCUMENT-PROFILES.md "Three digests, not one"), never a replacement.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS, so anyone can recompute it from the artifact with two stock
 * tools: the sha256 of the `content.xml` member's INFLATED bytes, exactly
 * as `readPart` proves them whole (length and CRC-32 against the central
 * directory). For `.ods` no byte of content.xml is rewritten; for `.odt` the
 * list ids Google mints per export are relabelled (D-473, below). Outside content.xml the
 * package's other members are discounted, and each discount is a region
 * judgment §5 licenses: `meta.xml` (generation timestamps, the producer's
 * stamp — mechanical), `settings.xml` (view state — mechanical), the ZIP
 * envelope (per-request timestamps and order — mechanical, MEASURED to move),
 * `styles.xml`, `Thumbnails/` and the font faces content.xml names (page
 * styles, a preview and glyph shapes — presentational; D-612, below).
 *
 * WHY content.xml CAN SPEAK FOR THE SUBSTANCE, AND WHEN IT CANNOT. OpenDocument
 * puts the whole body — every cell, its formula beside its value, every
 * annotation and tracked change — in content.xml (this module's header). What
 * it does NOT hold is the bytes of a member it REFERENCES: an image under
 * `Pictures/`, an embedded object or chart under `Object N/`. A changed image
 * under an unchanged name would leave content.xml byte-identical, and a digest
 * that folded those two captures would hide a real change — the one failure
 * §"The failure asymmetry" says matters. So a package whose content.xml
 * references ANY member of the package is UNDETERMINED, naming the member;
 * the rule is the reference, not a list of directory names, so a producer
 * that puts an image somewhere else is caught the same way.
 *
 * WHY ONLY `.ods`, AND THE SPLIT IS THE ROW'S OWN ALTERNATIVE ("state it, or
 * split .odt out"). A normalisation is added only on MEASUREMENT (DOCUMENT-
 * PROFILES.md, "The failure asymmetry"):
 *   .ods  content.xml byte-identical across exports: 3 of 3 (MEASUREMENTS.md
 *         2026-09-14 §4) and 18 of 18 over 3 census targets (M-123). No
 *         normalisation is needed and none is applied.
 *   .odt  content.xml differs raw on exports carrying a list: M-123 found the
 *         class on 2 documents — a random `xml:id` on `<text:list>`. D-473
 *         RE-MEASURED it (M-167, a fresh population of public government Docs,
 *         two rounds apart in time): the only difference in every list-bearing
 *         pair is `text:list@xml:id`, and content.xml relabelled by
 *         `odtNormalisedContentXml` is byte-stable on every pair the digest can
 *         reach. The one other class M-167 saw (`draw:frame@draw:name`,
 *         `imageN` permuted per export) occurs only where content.xml references
 *         a `Pictures/` member, which the member rule below already refuses.
 *   .odp  content.xml raw byte-stable on every pair M-167 read, but every deck
 *         in that population references a package member, and the census holds
 *         no Slides target (M-123). UNDETERMINED until a census target is
 *         measured (M-167 names it).
 * Widening this is one entry in `ODF_EVIDENTIARY_MEASURED` plus the

/* D-473 — THE `.odt` NORMALISATION: RELABEL THE LIST IDS GOOGLE MINTS PER EXPORT.
 * M-123 found, and D-473's measurement (M-167) re-measured over a fresh population,
 * that Google writes a fresh random `xml:id` on every `<text:list>` at every
 * export (`list888038964` → `list3685929024`). An `xml:id` is an identifier
 * and says nothing a reader sees; what it CAN carry is a relationship — a list
 * whose `text:continue-list` names another list's id continues that list's
 * numbering, which a reader does see. So the ids are not stripped: each
 * `xml:id` on a `text:list` start tag is RELABELLED `L1`, `L2`, … in document
 * order, and every `text:continue-list` naming a relabelled id is rewritten to
 * its label. Two exports that differ only by the random ids then carry one
 * digest, and a list that continues a DIFFERENT list still moves it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT REACH, so the rule is not read as wider than it is: it
 * matches the literal qualified names `text:list`, `xml:id` and
 * `text:continue-list` as Google writes them. A producer binding the text
 * namespace to another prefix is not normalised, its digest moves on every
 * export and the capture reads CHANGED — the safe direction (a change claimed,
 * never a sameness). A `text:continue-list` naming an id no list carries is
 * left verbatim. content.xml that is not valid UTF-8 is refused (null), never
 * decoded lossily, because a replacement character would make two different
 * byte strings equal for free. */
