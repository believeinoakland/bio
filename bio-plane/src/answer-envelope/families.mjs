/* answer-envelope: THE COMPOSED CATALOGUE (R2, R7, `control-plane` R41; K585 (1), N245, N272, N337, N403, N414). Copied
   whole from `control-plane/families.mjs` at the split (T35-80; K1907, K1974). Every DEC-49 family a refusal can be
   decorated from: every product module's own families in the order of `build/modules.json`, then this module's own,
   last and alone (the check catalogue, which once came first, ended with `control-plane` R43, now R7, at T19). Each
   source is read as a NAMESPACE and its families found by the reserved `_CHECKS` suffix, so a family a module adds to
   a file listed here is found with no edit; a module that opens a NEW file of families is not, and `CHECK_FAMILY_FILES`
   gains it. A module test walks every product module's files for an exported family and fails on one this list does
   not reach, so the list cannot go stale silently.

   `CHECK_FAMILIES` is `{FAMILY: {code: row}}` with each code ONCE: the first source that holds a row for it with a canned
   translation keeps it, else the first that holds it at all. A code held in two places is the DEC-49 guard's arm A to
   refuse, not this composition's to choose, and a family name two sources share (a row held twice for a tranche, K529)
   is one family here. `dec49Row` (R2) and the published fences (`control-plane` R41, `skills.machineFences` over it)
   read this one object. */
