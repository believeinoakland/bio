/* =========================================================================
 * D-262 — THE CATALOGUE ROW, ATTACHED ON THE WAY OUT. ONE PLACE.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG, MEASURED RATHER THAN SUSPECTED. Twelve `MACHINE_CANNOT_*`
 * fences fire; twelve carry a catalogued C-number and a canned translation
 * (REC-64 wrote eleven of them); **exactly ONE put either on the wire.** That
 * one — `MACHINE_CANNOT_MOVE_VERSION` — is the only site in the family that
 * refuses through a helper that reads the catalogue row. The other eleven build
 * `{ ok: false, reason: "MACHINE_CANNOT_…", detail: … }` by hand, and a hand
 * cannot carry a row it does not read. So a member's agent met the string
 * `MACHINE_CANNOT_RELEASE` and nothing else, which is the exact failure DEC-49
 * exists to prevent, surviving inside the mechanism built to prevent it.
 *
 * WHY A DECORATION AND NOT ELEVEN EDITS — decided by measurement, and the
 * measurement is the reversal cost as much as the write cost. Eleven site edits
 * are eleven places to be right and eleven places to be wrong, and they close
 * ELEVEN sites out of a plane that mints hundreds of refusals in eight
 * separately-written `refuse` closures; the twelfth site proves the per-site fix
 * does not generalise, because it was written and the other eleven still were
 * not. This file already rules on the shape: `doAnswer`'s own header says *"the
 * fix is a CHOKEPOINT, not twenty-four remembered checks, because a rule that
 * must be remembered at every site is a rule that will be forgotten at the
 * twenty-fifth."* `json()` is that chokepoint on the way OUT — **MEASURED
 * 2026-08-09: 118 of `control-plane/index.mjs`'s 125 response returns go through `json()`, and
 * the other 7 are `new Response(...)` returning a 204, a version string, two
 * HTML pages and three byte bodies — not one of them a refusal carrier.** It
 * covers the generic store forward AND the 36 `doAnswer` handlers that never
 * reach that forward. Eleven site edits would have closed the generic forward's
 * eleven and left every one of the 36 exactly as it was.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS TO REVERSE: delete this block and the one call above. Nothing
 * else in the plane depends on it, because nothing in the plane READS these
 * three fields — they exist for the caller. That is the asymmetry that decided
 * it: the decoration's blast radius is one function, and eleven site edits'
 * blast radius is eleven member-facing methods.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, and each is a fence rather than an omission:
 *
 *   - **IT NEVER OVERWRITES.** A field already present is left exactly as the
 *     site wrote it. So a site that says something DIFFERENT from the catalogue
 *     is not silently corrected into agreement — R2's tests
 *     (`test/m/answer-envelope/envelope.test.mjs`) drive a field already present
 *     and see it kept. A decoration that overwrote would make a comparison of
 *     what the caller RECEIVED against the row unable to fail, which is the
 *     "equality that costs nothing" this project refuses.
 *   - **IT NEVER INVENTS.** A code with no catalogue row is left bare and is
 *     reported by the instrument as census. Untranslated codes are REC-64's
 *     remaining sweep; making one up here would hide that work rather than do
 *     it.
 *   - **IT ADDS NO CODE OF ITS OWN**, so it mints nothing DEC-49 must catalogue
 *     and it moves no floor in the guard.
 *   - **IT DOES NOT MAKE A SITE'S CODE INVISIBLE.** Every code stays a STRING
 *     LITERAL at its site; arm C of the DEC-49 guard still COMPARES it. This
 *     decoration is downstream of the guard's whole subject and replaces none
 *     of it.
 *
 * REACH, STATED PLAINLY BECAUSE IT IS NOT TOTAL: this covers what leaves through
 * `json()`. The eight `new Response(...)` returns in `control-plane/index.mjs` (bytes, HTML, the
 * setup and signing pages) do not pass through it and are not refusal carriers;
 * a future one that IS would be outside this and is exactly what the
 * instrument's op sweep would find.

/* ===============================================================   REC-52: A FAILURE TO ANSWER IS NOT AN ANSWER, AND THE PLANE MUST NOT
   CONVERT ITS OWN INTO A CLAIM ABOUT THE RECORD.
   ===============================================================
   THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, stated once so the next reader does not have to
   reconstruct it. The Durable Object answers in exactly one envelope:

       { ok: true,  result: <whatever the method returned> }        // it answered
       { ok: false, error: <stack> }                       500      // it threw
       { ok: false, error: "unknown op: <op>" }            400      // no such method
       { ok: false, reason: "BAD_JSON", detail: … }        400      // unreadable body

   Twenty-four handlers in `control-plane/index.mjs` used to read `.result` off that envelope
   WITHOUT LOOKING AT `ok`, and JavaScript makes both failure modes silent:

     - `json({ ok: true, ...out.result })` spreads `undefined`, which is a
       no-op, so what leaves the control plane is `{ok:true}` at HTTP 200 —
       a SUCCESSFUL envelope carrying nothing. Section 7a (`op=verify`) was
       the measured instance, and UI-37 could not fix its own defect by making
       the transport throw on `ok:false` BECAUSE THERE WAS NO `ok:false` TO
       THROW ON; the motivating case sailed straight past.

     - `(c || { reason: "NOT_PUBLISHED" })` and `if (!v || !v.published)
       return notFound()` turn an absent answer into a SUBSTANTIVE NEGATIVE:
       the plane telling a stranger that the record does not hold that part,
       when in fact the plane failed to ask. This is the defect this project
       ranks worst — the record asserting something it does not know — and it
       sits at the layer BENEATH every surface, where no surface can correct
       it. A surface that faithfully renders what it received will faithfully
       render a lie.

   THE FIX IS A CHOKEPOINT, not twenty-four remembered checks, because a rule
   that must be remembered at every site is a rule that will be forgotten at
   the twenty-fifth. `doAnswer` is the ONLY place in `control-plane/index.mjs` that opens a
   Durable Object envelope, and R3's tests (`test/m/answer-envelope/envelope.test.mjs`)
   drive every relay with a store that answers nothing, a non-JSON body, a stack and
   its own refusal.

   `answered` is `ok === true` AND NOTHING ELSE. It is deliberately NOT
   "result is present and non-empty": a store method may legitimately answer
   `null`, `[]` or `{}`, and treating a real empty answer as a non-answer
   would be this same collapse running in the opposite direction — which is
   one character away and is asserted against in its own arm.

   WHAT THE CALLER IS TOLD, and why it says so little. `storeSilent` reports
   the state of the EXCHANGE and makes no statement about the record at all,
   because there is none to make. It does NOT echo the Durable Object's
   `error`: that field is a raw stack trace (`String(e && e.stack || e)`),
   and every op below that can reach this refusal — verify, publishedcase,
   publishedbytes, publishedmanifest, bootstrap — is reachable with NO
   credential of any kind. An anonymous stack trace is a disclosure, and a
   diagnostic a stranger cannot act on is not worth one. */
