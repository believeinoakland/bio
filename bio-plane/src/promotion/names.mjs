/**
 * Membership v2 §11 item 8: project name uniqueness enforced IN THE CHECK
 * CATALOG as well as at the write path. The write path refuses a colliding
 * write (`promote` and `forkProject`, NAME_TAKEN); nothing could
 * judge a corpus handed in from elsewhere — an export, a migration, another
 * group's instance, §11 item 9's pre-enforcement recheck — until this.
 *
 * A CORPUS-level check, deliberately outside `checkBundle`: uniqueness is a
 * fact about a SET of bundles and no single bundle can carry it.
 *
 * The rule is §7.1's three consequences, in full:
 *   - compared by `projectNameKey` (case-insensitive, whitespace collapsed);
 *   - across EVERY lifecycle state: a deactivated (`closed`) project is still
 *     cited and its name must still resolve to what was cited, so there is NO
 *     state filter here and there must never be one;
 *   - about the project OBJECT: only bundles whose `object_type` is `project`.
 *
 * C-77.1 (error) names EVERY colliding PAIR, by bundle id and title — three
 * projects on one key are three pairs, because each pair is a separate thing
 * somebody has to resolve.
 *
 * C-77.2 (warning) names every bundle this check could NOT judge, which is
 * first-class rather than silence: a bundle with no readable `bundle.md` (it
 * may or may not be a project) and a project with no title (its key is empty,
 * so it can collide with nothing; the write path refuses it NO_TITLE). A clean
 * result over a corpus with C-77.2 findings is a clean result over the part
 * that could be read, and the finding says which part could not.
 *
 * @param {Iterable<{folderName?: string, files: Map<string, string|Uint8Array>}>} corpus
 *   the catalog's own BundleInput shape, one per bundle
 * @returns {{pass: boolean, findings: Finding[], projects: number, judged: number}}
