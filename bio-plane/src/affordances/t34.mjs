/* affordances — R45 (K1864): THE OPS T34 DECLARES IN `op-declarations` R22–R24, R26, R28 AND R15, graded by R7 and R27
 * with R12's totality holding over them, each grade read from its owner's requirements as R40 does; and R21's ALIASES,
 * each taking its op's grade and reason through one frozen table, so an alias never differs from its op. Data only: no
 * op's behaviour is decided here (P6). `../affordances.mjs` spreads the three tables and applies `aliased` to its own.
 * This file imports nothing, so the spread closes no cycle. */
