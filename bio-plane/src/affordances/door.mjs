/* affordances — `op=affordances` (R17), THE plane-sourced act pre-flight (REC-19, DEC-8): for this object as it stands,
 * which acts exist — each with the capability it needs, how it is reached, its set-application weight and its declared
 * ladder rung — plus the object vocabularies, so a surface renders what it received and keeps no copy of any of it.
 *
 * Moved from `src/index.mjs` (T19 layer 11, legacy-index's map §4.1 (1)). The control plane keeps what is its own (K3):
 * routing, the four stamps (`viewer`, `identity`, `author`, `by`, composed by the expressions the acts receive them by),
 * the gate (`{needs, mode}` from `NEEDS` and `SESSION_OPS`, the tables that actually gate the call) and its envelope and
 * store-silence answers, each HANDED IN here; this module composes the answer from them (R11, R17).
 *
 * Two parts. `affordancesAnswer` is the composition, pure: the catalogue or one target's acts, decorated through the gate
 * by `decorate` — the SAME function a queue item's options go through, so the two answers cannot drift (REC-20, R11).
 * `affordancesOp` is the door's arm: it asks the store what the composition needs (the kinds this instance's
 * `actions` accepts, and the target's facts, or with no target the screens and offered wizard scripts, R37) and answers through the envelope it was handed.
 *
 * Nothing is asked of the caller and nothing here writes (R22). `rung` is DECLARED, never guessed, and since FW-14 it is
 * TOTAL: every op the control plane declares mutating carries a rung or is named with the GROUND on which it has none
 * (R12, R24), so `rung: null` is always accompanied by a non-null `rung_absence`. */
