/* affordances — the FACTS behind op=affordances (R13–R16, R23), and only the facts: what this object is, where its
 * state machine stands, which citation edges touch it, and where the caller stands towards it. The DERIVATION (which
 * acts those facts admit) is `deriveActs` in `../affordances.mjs`, and this file holds no copy of any act rule.
 *
 * Extracted from the legacy store (T9, K225, N45, N176): `store.mjs` `affordanceFacts` and the three joined-project
 * predicates `#joinedCitingProjectOf`, `#concludedForJoinedProjectOf`, `#editionWarrantedForJoinedProjectOf`, whose
 * only caller it was. The legacy comments moved with them, shortened where they only restated the code.
 *
 * EVERY FACT IS ASKED THROUGH THE PREDICATE THE CORRESPONDING ACT'S REFUSAL RUNS (R14), never a second copy of the
 * same question, so a published act and the refusal it fronts cannot disagree (DEC-8): live citations through
 * `connections.citesInto` (retire's CITED guard), reinstatable edges through `citation.retiredNotCitable`
 * (`#edgeTransition`'s), what rests on a question through `inquiry.restsOnLive` (divide's CITED guard), the case
 * relation through `case-tensions.caseRelation` (its R1; N597), a project's conclusion through `basis-versions.conclusionOf` and
 * `ratification.caseConclusionFor` / `editionsRecordingConclusion` (publishCase()'s gates), whether the viewer sees both
 * sides of a contradiction inquiry's candidate through `contradiction.candidateSidesSeen` (resolve's C-93.27 check), and
 * every position through `membership`'s predicates.
 *
 * FACTS ARE COUNTS, NEVER IDS (R16): op=affordances answers about the TARGET, and handing back WHICH bundles cite it,
 * or rest on it, would be §7.9's reverse-edge walk arriving by a new door. `op=backlinks` is the gated read that
 * answers that question.
 *
 * THREE-VALUED POSITIONS (R10, R15): a positional fact is null on a target of the wrong type and for a caller with no
 * roster position (a `class:*` credential); the catalogue never narrows on a null and offers a roster act only on a
 * stated `true`. Never writes (R22).
 *
 * REACHED as `affordancesOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host (the Durable Object's `ctx`). The modules it
 * asks are reached through their factories on the same host at the moment of the call, when the Durable Object has
 * already made each of them with its own options; `deps` (a test's) replaces any of `record`, `membership`,
 * `connections`, `citation`, `inquiry`, `caseTensions`, `basisVersions`, `ratification`, `contradiction`, `wizardScripts`.
 *
 * R37 (N528): the second route, `op=affordancescreens`, answers what the untargeted `op=affordances` publishes of
 * `wizard-scripts`: the registered screens and, for each, the offered scripts that start there for this viewer. */
