/* affordances — R39 (B1a.15; K1486): THE CLOSED VOCABULARIES T33'S NEW MODULES REFUSE AGAINST, WITH THE WORDS MEMBERS SEE.
 *
 * Each is published as `{values, words}`: `values` the very object its owner answers (the same reference, never a copy,
 * R4's terms), and `words` mapping each value to `{word}`, or `{word, provisional: true}`. The word is, in R39's order as
 * R62 (K3366; DEC-253) amends it:
 *   1. the design's word for the value, read by key through `setup-words`' `word` (`label.linekinds.*`, `label.linecapacities.*`,
 *      `label.lineroles.<kind>.*`, `label.money{kinds,phases,stages,bases,precisions}.*`, `label.identityclaimkinds.*`, and for a
 *      connection kind `label.connectionkinds.*`): this module holds no English, only the key each value is read by;
 *   2. else the owner's word registered with `connection-grammar` (`kindOf`), where the owner registers the value as a kind
 *      (events' roles and relation kinds, every connection kind the design keys no word of);
 *   3. else one plain word made from the value itself (underscores and joined words spaced, `Event` dropped from a
 *      status), marked `provisional: true` until the design stream keys one.
 * No word says "knows", "network", "conflict", "suspicious" or "most connected", or "ledger", "diverted" or "misused".
 *
 * A vocabulary whose owner is not composed answers ABSENT, never empty: an owner is composed once it has registered with
 * `connection-grammar`'s default registry (events at its `start`, the plane's composition; lines, money and people at
 * load), so the answer is read at the moment of the call, as `action_kind` is (R26). Nothing here writes (R22). */

/* R59 (K3250, K3254; walk row 15; `screens-investigate` R24), R60 (N1090; DEC-236 (B204 (3))): each connection kind's design group, the
 * design's six (the Follow choices of `mock-screens.js`'s graph, its `KINDS`): `pos` "Positions and memberships", `part` "Took part",
 * `money` "Money", `ment` "Mentioned together", `same` "Same person?", `step_source` (its own, R60). A frozen map in this module, never the owners': the groups are the design's, the
 * kinds the owners'. Every kind the registry holds is in it (the test is total over the registry); the design gives no group to the
 * kinds below that no screen draws as people's ties, so each takes the design group its own meaning is nearest, BOB's to re-rule:
 *   pos    a post, a membership or a standing relation of bodies and offices: `line:*` (the posts held, `line:holds:*`, and the
 *          structure between bodies), `entities`' three, and the standing duties (`owes`, `owed_to`, `holds_power`);
 *   part   a recorded event or decision a party took part in: every `event_*` kind, the duty's meeting and use (`met_by`,
 *          `used_in`), the law and court links between instruments (`law_*`, `court_*`, `in_force_at_event`), and a stage placed on
 *          a declared flow;
 *   money  `money_flow`;
 *   ment   the weakest ties, a lead and never a finding: `mentioned_together`, a member's `hunch`, `in_tension_with`;
 *   same   a member's claim about whether two records are one person (`same_as`, `not_same_as`, `unsure`);
 *   step_source  (R60) a step backed by a passage (`step_source`): neither "Mentioned together" nor a position, so its own group. */
