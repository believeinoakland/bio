/* affordances — ACT_HELP (R48, R53, R54, R56, R57, R61, R62, R69, R70; N726, DEC-174 (3) as amended (U117), DEC-99, K3366): the one table of
 * what each act does, one explanation per op, keyed by op.
 *
 * WORDS BY KEY (R62; K3366, K3368; DEC-257, DEC-258). This module holds no member-facing English: each op is bound to the key of
 * its sentence in the interface's word list (`act.<op>.does`; the exceptions below, where the design keys the text by an alias or
 * by an `owed_` tag it has not yet cleared), and `ACT_HELP` is each key read through `setup-words`' `word`. The text is the
 * design stream's `docs/development/ux-substrate/screens/mock-acts.js` as it stands on `main` at PR #37's merge (`f498560a37`;
 * DEC-229 to DEC-241, DEC-245, DEC-246), 338 entries, held verbatim by the word list (R61), and re-read at the design commit `8c5e692e19` (R70);
 * a later design text is a re-generation
 * of the list below, not a re-wording here. A key the list lacks fails the load (`UNKNOWN_WORD`), as `attestFence` does, so the
 * plane never answers an explanation it cannot make true.
 *
 * Its keys are read as R48 reads them, the ops held in the design's order:
 *   - a declared op is that op; an alias (`op-grades`' OP_ALIASES, `op-declarations` R21's table) is held under its op, never as
 *     a second entry (the design gives `readtranslate` both bare and as `owed_readtranslate`, the one text, held once);
 *   - `owed_<op>` is held under `<op>` once `<op>` is declared or spelled `op=` (R61): the six DEC-248 cleared
 *     (`readtranslate`, `projectfork`, `versionconsider`, `versionreject`, `versionrevert`, `versioncurrent`), `updatestart`,
 *     `updatelater`, `updateskip`, `passwordresetlink`, and `founderhandleset`, which `op-declarations` R71 declares in T49
 *     (K2999's rule: R34's partition holds at both merges). T50 (R65): `projectstakeset`, `actionstake`, `watchitem`, `secondlook`
 *     and `actioninquiry` are held under their ops, read from `act.owed_<op>.does` as the word list holds them (their ops
 *     are declared, `op-declarations` R73), so no held key starts `owed_`; `secondlookclear` is held under its own
 *     `act.secondlookclear.does`;
 *   - T50 (R64, R66; DEC-264, DEC-309 (5)): `reauth` (`act.reauth.does`) and `aliaswithdraw` (`act.owed_aliaswithdraw.does`),
 *     `factconfirm`, `projectrequest`, `projectrequestwithdraw` and `projectrequestanswer` (each `act.<op>.does`) are held
 *     under their ops, and so leave `op-declarations`' `ACT_HELP_ABSENT` (its R75);
 *   - `handlechange`: the design's text still describes a change of handle, which `membership` R129 refuses whatever is asked
 *     (DEC-197), so it is not read; the help states the refusal, `membership`'s own `HANDLE_FIXED` row read by reference (R53);
 *   - T51 (R70; DEC-340, U366): `holdnoticeprepare` and `counselpacket` are held (`actionhold`'s and `holdnoticesent`'s texts are the
 *     design's new ones, read by key), as are `noticeprepare`, `noticepost`, `signeradd` and `versionnotice`, whose `does` words the
 *     design's reads list for this module gives (R62); `op-declarations`' `ACT_HELP_ABSENT` keeps none of them;
 *   - T51 (K4093; DEC-359): `actionholdrelease`, which the design @ `2a64c5ae77` explains, is held (R70 re-taken at that design);
 *   - T51 (K4248, B12): `strengthbarset` is held under its own text, `act.strengthbarset.does`, in `T51_DESIGN_OPS`; `strengthbar`, an op
 *     whose text the design does not give and which no screen sends (the screens send `strengthbarset` and `projectbarset`), is held none;
 *   - T51 (G49, K4680): `capturerequests`, `casedrafts` and `readheld`, whose `act.<op>.does` words the design's reads list now gives, are
 *     held in `T51_DESIGN_OPS` (`readheld` was a stand-in until its design row landed);
 *   - T51 (K4900; `capture` R113): `captureuploadbegin`, `captureuploadpart`, `captureuploadcomplete` and `captureuploadabort`, the steps the
 *     page takes to send a large file in parts, are held in `T51_DESIGN_OPS` (stand-ins until DEC-431 gave their rows, K4968);
 *   - T51 (R69): the seven browser acts, `BROWSER_ACTS`, are held under their own names from `act.owed_<name>.does`;
 *   - `projectownervotes` has no text in the design and is held none (`op-declarations` names it in `ACT_HELP_ABSENT`, R61);
 *   - `selftest` (FR-40, K4190): the word list holds `act.selftest.does` for the updates screen (DEC-376), but this module's reads
 *     list (R62) does not give it and no act this module draws is `selftest` (instance-setup's probe), so it is held none.
 * A retired op is not held. */
