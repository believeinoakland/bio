/* affordances — R40 (C:A-16; B1a.16; K1522): THE OPS T33'S NEW MODULES PUBLISH, AND THE OPS T33 ADDS TO EARLIER ONES,
 * graded by R7 and R27 with R12's totality holding over them. Data only: no op's behaviour is decided here (P6).
 *
 * Each writing op has a rung (`T33_RUNGS`) or one ground of `RUNG_ABSENCE_GROUNDS` (`T33_RUNG_ABSENT`), on R27's rule:
 * `reasoned` where the owner refuses the act without the member's authored account (the code beside it, each in
 * `JUSTIFICATION_REFUSALS`, R19), `reversible` where a published act of the owner's takes the result back, and
 * `undetermined` where neither holds; the other grounds where the act is no act on the record (a setting beneath it, a
 * measurement, a member's own attention). Every op, read or write, carries its `NON_ACTS` reason (`T33_NON_ACTS`), since
 * `op-declarations` R17–R20 gives each a `NEEDS` row (`contribute` for a write, `null` for a read): none is an act on a
 * bundle's state that `affordanceFacts` describes, so none is an `ACTS` row and `MACHINE_REFUSALS` gains nothing (R7,
 * R20: it holds only `ACTS`); each owner refuses a machine by its own code where it does.
 *
 * `../affordances.mjs` spreads these three tables into `RUNGS`, `RUNG_ABSENT` and `NON_ACTS`; this file imports nothing,
 * so the spread closes no cycle. Grouped by owner, in `modules.json` order. */
