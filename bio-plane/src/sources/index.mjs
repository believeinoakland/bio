/* sources — the person behind material given to the group (requirements: `build/requirements/sources.md`; Intake
 * Doctrine §2a, DEC-78 items 2, 3 and 5; Bob's K509 (1), (4), (5); T33-22: K1449, K1492 (3)). A source is the knocker who handed material over,
 * and later whoever is revealed behind them, held as a dated, attributed history of disclosures, never one overwritten
 * field. It also answers what of a source may be published, and to whom, and how far the source is known (the ladder).
 * And it holds the mark that a capture is a result a member reached on their own paid account (a member-keyed outside
 * source, R16–R18): cited at a lower grade, never reproducible by the public, marked one capture at a time by the
 * member who captured it, never in bulk and never unattended.
 *
 * A new module (K509 (1), N364): nothing moves. Its tables (`./schema.mjs`) are append-only and exempt from purge
 * (R13), each declared with its classes (R19). Its rows are its own family, C-121 (`./checks.mjs`, R14).
 *
 * WHERE A SOURCE COMES FROM (R1). `capture` is earlier in the order and cannot call this module, so a source is
 * derived at read from the knocks capture pulled into a capture (its R72, R65, R66) and minted on first read and kept:
 * one per pseudonym, one per knock sent without a secret. A pulled knock's bytes are filed under their own digest (capture
 * R65), so the capture's digest is the knock's `sha256`; the capture's own `source` is rebuilt from the row exactly as
 * capture R65 composes it. A capture that is not a pulled knock has no source here: the capturing member is never
 * recorded as the source of what someone else gave them (R12).
 *
 * WHO SEES WHAT. A source is seen by a viewer naming a member (the inbox's fence, capture R32); a machine credential
 * or no viewer is answered `NO_SUCH_SOURCE`. A stored value is read only by the members its entry lists (R5), each
 * read logged. `by` and `viewer` are the control plane's stamps, never a body's.
 *
 * REACHED as `sourcesOf(ctx, deps)` (K61): one instance per Durable Object storage, created on the first call with
 * `deps` and returned to every later caller. At creation it creates its tables and declares them to purge, every one
 * exempt (R13). `deps`:
 *   record, membership, capture, provenance   the modules it uses, through their factories on the same storage unless
 *                                 a test passes its own (`capture` and `provenance` are reached lazily, on first use).
 *   now                           the module's clock, milliseconds since the epoch (default: the wall clock).
 *
 * THE OPS (routed and stamped by `control-plane`, layer 11; `sourcesOps` below): `sourcedisclose` (R2–R5),
 * `sourcelink` (R6), `sourceconsent` and `sourceconsentwithdraw` (R7), `knockerconsent` (R11, no account), `sourcekeyed`
 * (R16; `keyedResultOf`, R17, is read in process by the modules that grade a fact citing a capture), and the
 * reads `sourceof` (R1), `sourcerung` (R9), `sourcereadlog` (R5) and `sourcepublishable` (R8). */
