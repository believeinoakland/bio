/* REC-21 — the PERSONAL half of the queue, kept structurally distinct from the
 * record half, and the one doctrine rule that keeps them apart.
 *
 * THE RULE, and it is doctrine rather than preference (D-125's first-named
 * hazard, restated by DEC-16): **muting is PERSONAL and dismissing is a RECORD
 * ACT, and they must never be one control.** An OBLIGATION leaves everyone's
 * list when it is RESOLVED, which is record state. A FINDING leaves the list
 * when it is adopted, deferred or dismissed, which is an authored record act
 * carrying its author and reason (op=proposedispose). A CONDITION — a fact
 * about our own machinery rather than about the world — is acknowledged or
 * MUTED, and that is personal only: the condition persists and every other
 * member still sees it (NOTIFICATIONS.md, "MARKED AS HANDLED", which calls this
 * "the rule most likely to be lost when someone implements a delete button").
 *
 * CORRECTED 2026-09-22 by BOB #26's ruling (D-125, NOTIFICATIONS.md "MARKED AS
 * HANDLED"), built by D-125's landing: a member may PERSONALLY stop being
 * notified of a FINDING too — DEC-10's (b) per item and (c) per case over the
 * kinds named. That does not touch the rule above: a mute is keyed on the
 * MEMBER, so it removes nothing from any other member's list, and a finding
 * still leaves the TEAM's list only by the authored disposition, which a mute
 * never writes. The sentence below said "CONDITION KINDS ONLY" and guarded the
 * right hazard with the wrong key; it now reads OBLIGATION-free.
 *
 * SO `muted_kinds` MAY CONTAIN NO OBLIGATION KIND, and the fence is at the
 * WRITE, in queueMute, which is the ONE place the column is ever authored. The
 * concrete failure it prevents is stated by CRITIQUE.md and is worth carrying
 * here where the fence lives: an OBLIGATION is something a NAMED PERSON must do
 * for the record to proceed; a muted case would remove it from the only surface
 * that routes it; and `tasks` carries no per-member mute, so the record would go
 * on believing a question reached a person it cannot reach. Under DEC-16 that
 * is worse rather than better, because one member's resolution now clears every
 * other member's queue: the mute/resolve boundary is what stands between SHARED
 * RESOLUTION and SILENT DISAPPEARANCE.
 *
 * WHY THE CLASS IS CHECKED AT THE WRITE AND NOT AGAIN AT THE READ. A second
 * copy of a rule is a second place for it to drift (C-5, and the reason
 * op=dispose's duplicated state machine is named as the hazard not to repeat).
 * `muted_kinds` is written by exactly one method, which refuses anything that is
 * not a CONDITION kind, so membership in that column already MEANS "a condition
 * kind this member muted". The read therefore asks one question — is this
 * item's kind muted for one of the homes it appears under — and asks it of
 * every item, whatever its class. That is also what makes the failure OBSERVABLE:
 * remove the fence and a real obligation genuinely disappears from a real feed,
 * which is negative control (b) and is the whole point of running it.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE. It is PURE — no storage, no clock, no viewer — so
 * a suite can hold the decision to the store's own behaviour directly, exactly
 * as affordances.mjs lets the affordances suite hold deriveActs. The plane's store (`src/plane/store.mjs`)
 * cannot be imported outside workerd (it imports cloudflare:workers), and a
 * rule that can only be exercised through a Durable Object is a rule that gets
 * exercised less.
 */

/* THE CONDITION-KIND VOCABULARY is `observation-log`'s (R5; K78 (3), N49, N114): the condition kinds a look may
 * carry (C-22.4) and the kinds a member may lawfully mute are one list, kept in one place, so the two cannot drift.
 * It is a VOCABULARY, not a producer. What it gives the mute is the set of kinds a member may lawfully mute, which
 * is what the fence needs in order to refuse anything else BY NAME rather than by silence. The list is larger than
 * the feed can emit (not every kind has a producer), which is the safe direction: the fence accepts a mute for
 * a kind whose generator is not built, and the mint refuses any CONDITION kind this list does not name. A surface
 * never keeps a copy of it; it reads it from the refusal or from op=queue's own answer. */

 * `queue-producers` R15 until T45, from `action-clocks.overdueClocks`).
 * A CONDITION and not a FINDING (K611): it is said once, when the date passes, and a member quiets it for themselves;
 * the action's own record is where the overdue entry is met or waived. It is queue's to add and not observation-log's,

  /* PL-13 / IS-3, MINTED 2026-08-09, and BOTH ARRIVE WITH A PRODUCER. The plan
     row named these two slugs; UI-45 asserted them ABSENT so the gap would have
     an alarm on it rather than be a comment, and this is the item that sets the
     alarm off on purpose. Neither is a word without a generator: see queue-producers'
     `#findingsStanceDiverged` and `#findingsVersionFromAnotherTeam`.

     THEY EXIST BECAUSE D-216's ANSWER IS **PER-PROJECT** (measured 2026-08-08,
     driven through twelve ops, not read). An inquiry shared across projects
     holds NO stance in its own bytes; each project authors its own dated
     pointer, and two projects may stand on two different readings of one
     question SIMULTANEOUSLY with the plane refusing neither. That is the right
     model and it has a cost, which is exactly what these two kinds carry: the
     divergence is now INVISIBLE unless somebody is told, because nothing
     refuses it and nothing reconciles it. A model that permits divergence
     silently is a model that lets a team build a case on a reading its partners
     abandoned a month ago.

     FINDING AND NOT CONDITION, and it is doctrine rather than taxonomy — the
     plan row's own second negative-control arm turns on it. A CONDITION is a
     fact about OUR OWN MACHINERY and is personally MUTABLE (D-125, DEC-16). A
     divergence of stance is a fact about the WORLD OF THE WORK: another team
     reads the shared question differently. One member's inbox hygiene must not
     be able to make that disappear for everybody with nothing recorded.
     Both leave a list the way every finding does — by an authored, attributed
     act. CORRECTED 2026-09-23 (D-125, BOB #26's ruling): a member MAY now mute
     either one for THEMSELVES, because a mute is keyed on the member and moves no
     other member's list; the old `test/current.test.mjs` (deleted in T20) drove exactly that — the mute
     accepted, personal, writing no disposition, the finding still on a second
     member's feed — where it used to drive a refusal; `test/m/queue/feed.test.mjs`' R16 test holds it now. */

/* THE ADMISSION DECISION, and the ONLY one. Given a queue item (its kind and
 * the homes REC-20's every-ancestor walk gave it) and this member's mute rows,
 * answer WHICH case suppresses it, or null.
 *
 * `mutes` is a Map case_id -> Set(kind). It is deliberately not the raw rows:
 * building it is the store's business (it reads the table), deciding is this
 * function's, and the separation is what lets the suite ask the question
 * without a Durable Object.
 *
 * THE SCOPE RULE — a mute is scoped to the KINDS PRESENT WHEN IT WAS MADE. It
 * is enforced HERE by the plainest possible mechanism: membership. The mute
 * stores the kinds the member named; a kind that was not named is not in the
 * set; a NEW kind arriving on a muted case is therefore not suppressed and
 * still reaches them. There is no wildcard and no "mute the case" — muting a
 * CASE rather than its kinds is precisely the delete button the doctrine
 * forbids, and the shape of this column is what makes it unavailable.
 *
 * AN UNGROUPED ITEM CANNOT BE MUTED BY CASE, and that is not an oversight.
 * queue_state is keyed (member_id, case_id); an item with no home has no case to
 * mute against, and inventing a pseudo-case for it would be the same invented
 * home REC-20 refuses to give it. Its way out is the ITEM form (`mutedAsItem`
 * above, D-125/D-170), keyed on the item's own id and on no case. */
