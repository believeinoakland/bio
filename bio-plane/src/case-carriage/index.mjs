/* case-carriage — what a case edition carries at its commit (requirements: `build/requirements/case-carriage.md`;
 * DEC-112 (3), (4); BIO_Publication_v0_1.md §5C). `publication`'s commit calls it inside its own transaction: it holds,
 * by SHA-256, the materials the signed document includes, so `public-read` carries them in the case file from the
 * published projection alone (R1–R3), and it re-reads what the document rests on that may have changed since it was
 * prepared: what may be published of each source it states (R5; N364) and another group's work it accepted (R4; N522).
 * A document cut out of a captured archive is carried with its archive, its `container` record and the archive's tokens,
 * so an outsider re-derives it with stock tools (R8; N688, K1844).
 * (T37; N757, DEC-180) It holds the marks members make on a photo of who and what to obscure (R9, R10, R12) and derives
 * from the marks that stand, through `image-cover`, a copy carrying nothing of the original but its pixels, each marked
 * area covered (R11). (T38; N779, K2248) A published case carries every photo only as this copy (R1): never the original,
 * whole or inside an archive (R8). (T38; N788, DEC-183 (2)) A mark is withdrawn by a reasoned act recorded beside it,
 * never erased (R14). Inside the group every photo stays as taken. `marksLapsed` (R13) is publication's commit check.
 * The refusals those re-reads lead to, and every write to the published projection's other tables, are `publication`'s:
 * this module owns the two tables of held materials (`./schema.mjs`, exempt from purge, R6), the marks and the copies'
 * withdrawals and derivations (R12), and names no place (R7). Its own refusals (R9, R10, R14) are rows of C-141
 * (`./checks.mjs`).
 * (T39; N806, K2315, K2333) A member document, one this copy did not fetch (provenance R62), is carried only as its
 * cleaned copy from `doc-clean` (no picture or document metadata), or whole when it carries none (R1, R13): this
 * module queues it from each receipt that is not a fetch and from each miss (R15, R16), derives the copy on the
 * scheduler's wake (`copyBatch`, `copyWake`; R17 `onCopyWork` the arming notice) and answers its state synchronously
 * (`documentCopy`). Its archive is never carried (R8). Inside the group every document stays as it came.
 * (T46; N907, K2833, K2949) For `case-check` R2's latch, R4, R5 and R13 are each widened over the interval from a check's
 * `checked_at` through the read (`acceptedWorkLapsedSince`, `sourcesLapsedSince`, `marksLapsedSince`; R19–R21), as far as
 * accepted-work's withdrawals, sources at the two instants and this module's own append-only marks and copies answer it;
 * (T47; N947) and through accepted-work's flags' history (its R9) and the instants a source changed (sources R20), a flag
 * opened and cleared, or a consent withdrawn and restored, inside the interval. (T47; N953) The answers naming a copy
 * also answer the row's `obscured` object, its marker (`kind`) included, for the writer of a `materials:` row (R22).
 *
 * Split from `publication` by copy (K617, K624 (1), N532, K1332; seam map `build/extraction/publication-split-2.md`):
 * R57's holding (`#holdMaterials`, `#registered`, `#fileRow`, `#tokenFiles`, `heldMaterialsOf`,
 * `publishedMaterialText`), R59's re-read and R51's, with their comments, and the two tables. `publication`'s job
 * deletes its copy and creates this module. One change of shape at the seam: `holdMaterials` answers the `files` the
 * caller registers by hash, since every write to `published_shas` is `publication`'s.
 *
 * REACHED as `caseCarriageOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host (the Durable Object's `ctx`), created on the first
 * call with `deps`, returned to every later caller. At creation it creates its two tables and declares them to
 * record-core's purge as exempt (R6).
 * `deps` (each reached through its factory on the same host unless given; a test passes its own):
 *   record, membership, promotion   layer 2: `readFile` (R13), `declarePurge` (R21); membership and promotion only to
 *                                   construct the three below.
 *   extraction     `unitsOf` (its R36), for R1's extracted text.
 *   sources        `publishableAt` (its R8), for R5.
 *   acceptedWork   `acceptedFinding`, `openFlagsOn` (its R2), for R4; (T46) `acceptanceWithdrawals` (its R2), for R19;
 *                  (T47) `flagHistoryOn` (its R9), for R19. `sources` (T47) also `sourceChangesSince` (its R20), for R21.
 *   now            the clock for the instants it writes when the caller gives none, an ISO string (default: the wall
 *                  clock).
 *   bucket, store  (T37; R11) the evidence bucket (the Worker's `CAPTURES` R2 binding) and the store's namespace (a
 *                  string or a function answering one; default "bio"): the obscured copy is held at
 *                  `<store>/obscured/<sha>` (`obscuredKey`), beside file-safety's `<store>/derived/`, outside
 *                  `captures/`. The original is read through record-core's `evidenceStore` (its R38). Unbound, no copy
 *                  is made (R11 then answers `copy: null`, so a case cannot carry the photo).
 *   cover          `image-cover`'s `coverAreas` (a test may pass its own).
 *   provenance     (T39; R15–R17) `fetchedByThisCopy` (its R62) and `onReceipt` (its R47); the listener is registered
 *                  once, at creation.
 *   clean          `doc-clean`'s `cleanDocument` (a test may pass its own).
 *
 * READ CONTRACTS it joins in its own SQL: provenance's `register` (its R48: `capture_sha`, `bundle_id`, `path`, `bytes`),
 * record-core's `bundles` (its R37), sources' `source_knocks` (its R15) and (T38; R8, K2291 (2); asked of BOB in J1)
 * acquisition's `archive_entries` (R38's record of an archive's listing: `archive_sha`, `idx`, `name`, `kind`, `state`,
 * `sha256`), to tell whether an archive holds an image. */
