/* DEC-34's remaining half: the published case CONTAINER, serialised.
 *
 * REC-14 built the MANIFEST (`bio-case-container/1`) and put a `layout` block in
 * it "so REC-22 has a shape to build against rather than one to invent". This
 * module is the other end of that sentence: it reads the layout and writes the
 * zip. The manifest told us how; nothing here decides anything the manifest did
 * not already say.
 *
 * WHY STORE MODE (compression method 0) AND NOT DEFLATE. Three reasons, in
 * order of weight:
 *
 *   1. DETERMINISM IS THE PRODUCT. The container is served BY HASH, so two
 *      calls must produce byte-identical bytes or the hash a reader checks is
 *      not the hash they get. `CompressionStream("deflate-raw")` gives no
 *      guarantee of a stable encoding across runtime versions -- the output is
 *      valid, not fixed -- so compressing would make the container's identity
 *      depend on the workerd build that served it. Stored entries have exactly
 *      one encoding of a given byte string.
 *   2. THE PARTS ARE ALREADY COMPRESSED. A published case's bulk is captured
 *      PDFs and images; deflating them buys single-digit percentages.
 *   3. NO DEPENDENCY, and the same finding class that let ooxml.mjs read
 *      containers with zero dependencies (MEASUREMENTS 2026-08-03).
 *
 * The CRC-32 comes from `ooxml.mjs` -- the plane's one implementation, already
 * measured against real containers -- so what this module WRITES and what
 * `readContainer`/`readPart` READ agree by construction rather than by
 * agreement. That is also the suite's strongest assertion: the zip is read back
 * through the plane's own reader, which verifies every member's length AND its
 * CRC against the central directory before handing the bytes over.
 *
 * TAMPER-EVIDENT, NEVER TAMPER-PROOF (DEC-34, and the record must never claim
 * otherwise): nothing here encrypts, locks or write-protects anything. What
 * protects the container is that MANIFEST.json names every part by sha256, the
 * manifest itself answers by its own sha256 at op=publishedbytes, and the
 * signature covers the bundle sha. A modified copy is not prevented; it is
 * DETECTABLE by anyone holding it, without this instance's cooperation.
