 * Every value, finding and sentence is the copy's, unchanged; only C-73.6's `where` names its new site (stamped by 1.50.0).
 * Since T34 layer 9 (T34-87; DEC-149, K1811): a member reads "your group's Civicsmith" where three sentences said "this

 * Since T33 layer 9 (K1657): C-117.26–.28, the rows of `actions`' `NO_SUBJECT` (its R62), `MACHINE_CANNOT_SET_PROCEEDING` and
 * `NOT_A_PROCEEDING` (its R65), awaiting promotion's stamp; and C-11.1's past date is read on the office's local day

 * Since T27 layer 9: C-117.23–.25 (`actions` R52, R56, R58; DEC-113, N518; awaiting T28's stamp).
 * Since T20 layer 9: C-117.20–.22 (`actions` R52, K899 (7); stamped by 1.51.0), and a member reads "record" where the

 * The vocabularies and the leg, ledger, quote and lifecycle grammars are `./grammar.mjs`' (moved from the catalogue),

 *
 *  WHAT WAS WRONG. C-2.10 refused an EMPTY counterparty and accepted any
 *  non-empty string, so the intake surfaces' literal `to be named` satisfied
 *  the check by being a string and the record asserted a counterparty it did
 *  not have. That is the overclaiming class, in the one construct that reaches
 *  outside the system — and it is the same pressure D-97 removed at the intake
 *  gate when it made authority three-valued rather than forcing a caller to
 *  invent one. `undetermined` is first-class and must be STATED.
 *
 *  THE SHAPE, and why it is this one. `counterparty` becomes a MAP:
 *
 *      counterparty:
 *        state: named | undetermined
 *        name: City Clerk                 # required under `named`
 *        entity_id: ENT-2026-0007         # OPTIONAL, under `named` only
 *        basis: <why it is not determined> # required under `undetermined`
 *
 *  A one-level map of scalars at two spaces is exactly what the restricted
 *  frontmatter grammar admits (spec 2.2/3.3) and exactly what `source:
 *  {locator, authority, retrieved}` already is. Nothing here nests further:
 *  where a block needed a map AND a list, REC-14 and REC-16 split it into two
 *  TOP-LEVEL keys (`completeness` / `completeness_excluded`, `division` /
 *  `division_apportionment`) because the grammar cannot carry a map holding an
 *  array of objects. The counterparty needs no such split — it is one party,
 *  four scalars — so it is one block and the precedent is untouched.
 *
 *  NO COUNTERPARTY TABLE, and `entity_id` is why the temptation exists. A
 *  separate counterparty registry would be a second subject registry with a
 *  different doctrine attached, and that is exactly where a structural prior by
 *  ROLE would eventually be added — which this project's stance forbids
 *  outright (bad actors are identified BY EVIDENCE, never assumed by role). So
 *  a counterparty that is a known subject POINTS INTO the one registry and the
 *  registry stays the only place a party is described.
 *
 *  WHAT THIS CHECK CANNOT DO, stated rather than implied. (a) It cannot resolve
 *  `entity_id`: the catalog is a pure function over an injected filesystem and
 *  its only resolver seam is `resolveTarget`, which answers for BUNDLE ids.
 *  The shape is checked here; resolution would need a new seam threaded from
 *  `actions`' write, and no caller needs it yet. (b) It cannot detect
 *  invention in general — a member who types "the relevant department" gets
 *  past every rule below. The check is a BOUNDARY, not a prose judge; the
 *  control that stops the invention is the surface's radio pair with no third
 *  option and no default (UI-19), and a check that permits `undetermined`
 *  without a control that OFFERS it just moves the invention one field over.
 *  So exactly ONE placeholder is named here, and it is named because it was
 *  MACHINE-WRITTEN on every action by two intake surfaces rather than typed by
 *  anyone. */

 *
 *  ONE requirement, and it is the only one that is a fact about the bytes: the
 *  target is an ACTION id. The edge asserts "this document is what came back
 *  when we asked", and an edge of that name pointing at a question or at
 *  another document asserts a correspondence that never happened — the same
 *  class as a supersedes edge to nothing, which asserts a lineage. Resolution
 *  of the target in the store is enforced at the write, where a resolver exists
 *  (the supersedes precedent, for the same reason).
 *
 *  NO REASON IS REQUIRED, deliberately, and the asymmetry with `supersedes` is
 *  the point rather than an omission. Supersession is a member's JUDGEMENT that

 *  and any read agree by construction instead of by convention.
 *
 *  THE LINE IS STRUCTURAL AND AT THE WRITE PATH, which is the ruling's own
 *  wording. An action's recorded consequence is an OUTCOME by default: a dated,
 *  capturable, first-party fact about the body — a hearing convened, a study
 *  commissioned — that requires no causal claim at all and is carried at full
 *  strength. Promoting it to an IMPACT claim requires a `rests_on` leg pointing
 *  at evidence that is NOT OUR OWN ACTION: a council member's statement naming
 *  the report, a staff memo referencing it, a hearing record. What is refused
 *  is impact asserted from SEQUENCE ALONE, which is precisely the claim this
 *  record would refuse from a public body.
 *
 *  AND IT IS NOT A REFUSAL. `unproven` is a STATED STATE on R1's shape — no
 *  computed strength on this axis, and it names why — never a fifth grade and
 *  never a low one, because a low grade would say we established it weakly.
 *  So an impact claim with no outside evidence LANDS, and lands saying what it
 *  is. The machine never mints the stronger one (grade_source's discipline).
 *
 *  WHY A DOCUMENT THIS ACTION'S OWN CORRESPONDENCE PRODUCED DOES NOT COUNT: a
 *  reply we elicited is our own action's output. It is excellent evidence about
 *  the BODY (its non-response is fully claimable, DEC-13) and it is no evidence

 *
 * The list is set by ONE act, `op=actionlaws`, and by nothing else — not at creation, not by a revision through

 * read: a writer that filled a citation in at creation would pass every read-side assertion while the record
 * asserted a legal frame no member chose, so the creation arm is refused BY NAME (GOVERNING_LAWS_REWRITTEN).
 * The machine fence is C-32.18, in its own family.
 *
 * THE FOUR SHAPE ROWS MOVED THEIR `where` FROM `actionLaws` TO `#lawEntries` ON 2026-09-24 (REC-195), and the
 * move is the row's own rule working rather than a tidy-up: REC-195 adds a SECOND act that takes a list of
 * citations — `op=actionlawspropose`, the machine's PROPOSAL — and a `where` names THE SMALLEST SPAN IN WHICH
 * THE REFUSAL IS ENFORCED. Two acts each enforcing these four conditions in their own body would be two spans
 * for one row, which is the shape D-484 had to consolidate for `NO_BASIS`. So the grammar is one private helper
 * both acts ask, the region travelled with it unchanged, and the codes, the C-numbers and the translations are
 * the same four a member already meets.
 *
