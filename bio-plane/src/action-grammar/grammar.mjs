 *  refused BY NAME, because that is exactly the ask the Columbia review found
 *  at the centre of the Rolling Stone failure — a comment request with no

 *  carries at least one clock[] entry — the response window — and C-11.1
 *  already requires every clock entry to carry a basis (the statute, order or
 *  commitment the date derives from). RFC_RESPONSE_WINDOW_PRECEDENT carries

 *    due_cite    the citation it comes from — one of the action's D-149 governing laws (checked at the op,
 *                where the list is read; see below). Both or neither.
 *
 *  THE CLOCK IS NEVER ENCODED (D-149: the plane encodes no law's rules). Nothing here computes a due
 *  date from a kind, a law or a stage; with none stated it is UNDETERMINED, and `requestLifecycleOf`
 *  says so. What the plane derives is only what costs nothing to invent: days elapsed between dated

 *
 *  WHY `due_cite` IS JUDGED AGAINST THE LIST AT THE OP AND NOT HERE. This rule runs over every version
 *  of the document at promote, and the governing-law list is a member's act that may later change. A
 *  catalog arm refusing an entry whose cited law was later taken off the list would make op=actionlaws
 *  fail on history — an earlier dated statement made unwritable by a later one. So the op refuses a
 *  citation that is not on the list WHEN IT IS STATED (DUE_CITE_NOT_GOVERNING), and the read states,
 *  per entry, whether the citation is on the list NOW. A direct promote carrying a citation that was
 *  never on the list is therefore not refused here; the read says `on_list: false` for it.
