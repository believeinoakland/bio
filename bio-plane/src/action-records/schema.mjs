-- REC-195 (D-149's remaining half, BIO_Case_Making_v0_1.md §2): A MACHINE'S
-- PROPOSAL OF THE LAWS GOVERNING AN ACTION, STORED APART FROM THE MEMBER'S LIST.
--
-- D-149: *the machine may propose the list from the counterparty, labelled as
-- machine work, and never sets it*. THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS TABLE IS THE WORD
-- APART. The member's list lives in the action's own frontmatter
-- (governing_laws[], set by op=actionlaws and by nothing else, C-73.1), and a
-- proposal that shared that home would BE the list the moment anything read the
-- document -- the overclaim this row exists to refuse. So a proposal is not a
-- projection of the bytes, nothing writes it into them, and no read composes the
-- two: op=projection's action block serves governing_laws and
-- governing_laws_proposals as two separate answers, each saying whose it is.
--
-- KEYED (bundle_id, proposed_by, ord): ONE STANDING PROPOSAL PER PROPOSER, its
-- citations ordered as proposed. A proposer restating replaces its own rows and
-- nobody else's, which is themes' hunch discipline one construct over: the
-- record keeps who proposed what, and two machines proposing different lists is
-- two proposals rather than one overwriting the other.
--
-- NOTHING HERE IS DERIVED FROM THE COUNTERPARTY BY THIS PLANE. The proposer
-- supplies the citations and the levels, and the plane stores them under that
-- proposer's name and encodes no law's rules (D-149), which is why there is no
-- column mapping an agency to a law.
--
-- Carries bundle_id, so it clears in BOTH purge arms through the TABLES list
-- (D-113), and the module test of R11 (here; R36 in actions) holds that list against this file. A proposal
-- outliving the action it was made against would attach itself to whatever
-- bundle was next allocated that id -- somebody else's request wearing a
-- machine's citations.
