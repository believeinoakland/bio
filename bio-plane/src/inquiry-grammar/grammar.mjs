/* inquiry-grammar — THE GRAMMAR OF AN INQUIRY DOCUMENT (requirements: `build/requirements/inquiry-grammar.md` R1–R5,
 * R8–R18; T19 layer 6, K766; R11 at T28, N522; R12–R16 at T33; R17 at T34, N582; R18 at T41, D59).
 *
 * MOVED FROM THE CHECK CATALOGUE (`checks/bio-checks.mjs`, legacy-checks) UNCHANGED: the C-2.8 entry arm and the
 * division block (`checkInquiryExtension`, `checkDividedExtension`), the recheck coverage (C-15.1,
 * `checkRecheckCoverage`), supersession and the division disclosure (C-6.1), the leg grammar with its grounds,
 * testimony, earned and inherited arms (C-2.8, C-6.3, C-21.2) and its part (C-45 through `content`), and the lead
 * checker (C-54.1). The code below is the catalogue's text line for line; what changed is the imports, this header,
 * the finding helper's comment, and one call: `checkInquiryBasis` no longer calls `basisVersionFindings` (R4), which
 * is `basis-versions`' own grammar, run at the sub-slot `./index.mjs`' C-2.8 arm offers (R6). Every finding is the
 * catalogue's, in check, severity, message, repairs and code.
 *
 * WHAT IS READ FROM ELSEWHERE, and from where (the module's Uses):
 *   - `record-grammar`: the id, type, actor and grade vocabularies;
 *   - `content`: the extent face the leg's part is judged by (`checkContentExtent`, `legExtent`,
 *     `legHasAuthoredExtent`, `CONTENT_ID_RE`, `CONTENT_EXTENT_DOCUMENT_ONLY`; its R1, R48: all ten kinds, `doc-part` among them);
 *   - `text-chain`: the extent kinds the repair sentence lists (`CONTENT_EXTENT_KINDS`, its R92);
 *   - `connections`: `themeLegFindings` (C-81.1, its R46), asked of each leg before any other complaint about it;
 *   - `observation-log`: `LEAD_ID_RE`, a lead id's shape (its R14);
 *   - `civil-time`: `isCalendarDate`, whether a `YYYY-MM-DD` names a real day (its R6; R3 and the hunch's date, T33-43);
 *   - `standards`: `isPortionPath` and `PORTION_PATH_MAX`, a portion path's form (its R31; R13, N583);
 *   - `connection-grammar`: `derivedId`, a derived connection's id (its R11; R17, N582);
 *   - `duties`: `OCCURRENCE_KEY_RE`, an occurrence key's form (its R24; R15, N675).
 * Each of the last three is read from the file that states it and imports nothing of the record (`duties/vocab.mjs`
 * for the last, T35; K1799), so this grammar stays pure and the standalone case checker that bundles it carries no
 * store code.
 *
 * Pure (R9): nothing here reads or writes the record, the clock or the network; every function never throws on a
 * document it is handed, and the facts a check needs (the published and earned registries) are handed to it. */

 *  with the requirements, the way every state in the inquiry machine has
 *  arrived together with its entry requirements.
 *
 *  A REASON, because supersession is the heaviest member relation in the
 *  vocabulary: it says *this question replaced that one*, and an unexplained
 *  replacement is a change nobody can check. `links_to` is the precedent for
 *  requirements riding a rel; `sever with reason` is the precedent for the
 *  reason itself — the catalog already refuses moving an edge with no account.
 *
 *  A RESOLVABLE TARGET is the other half and is enforced in two places by
 *  construction rather than by agreement: C-6.2's resolver arm (record-grammar's references arm) catches it
 *  wherever a resolver is injected, and the store resolves it directly at the
 *  write. A supersedes edge to nothing points a reader at a question that does

 *  keys REC-14 RESERVED (`division_parent`, `division_siblings`) with no
 *  producer, so the published shape would not change under readers once cases
 *  existed. This item is the producer.
 *
 *  THE REASONING INVERTS THE ARGUMENT FOR DIVISION. Division was justified as
 *  the mechanism that stops weakest-link composition forcing a member to
 *  overclaim or stay silent. The abuse is the SAME mechanism: dividing is a
 *  cheaper way to shed a finding that cuts against you than severing it, and a
 *  published child that discloses neither parent nor siblings defeats invariant
 *  7 with a housekeeping operation. A reader who can see one half of a divided
 *  inquiry must be able to see that the other half EXISTS.
 *
 *  WHAT THIS FUNCTION CAN AND CANNOT SEE. It is pure over one document, so it
 *  holds the disclosure's SHAPE: a supersedes edge and the division keys agree
 *  with each other, the sibling list is present and non-empty, and it names
 *  neither the child itself nor its parent. Whether the list is COMPLETE — every
 *  sibling of that division and not merely one — cannot be answered from the
 *  child alone; the store answers it at the write against the parent's own
 *  `division.into`, and refuses NO_SIBLING_DISCLOSURE. Both halves are needed:
 *  this one makes an incoherent child impossible to author, and that one makes a

     "half a membership claim", and the shape it ALLOWED — both fields present —

     IT IS A REFUSAL RATHER THAN AN ABSENCE, and that is the load-bearing part.

/** REC-16 / DEC-28 / R4: what a `divided` parent must be able to say.
 *
 *  TWO TOP-LEVEL KEYS, and the split is forced by the restricted frontmatter
 *  grammar rather than chosen: a block is a map of scalars or an array of
 *  objects, never a map holding an array of objects. So `division` is the map
 *  (the act: into, apportioned_by, at, reason) and `division_apportionment` is
 *  the array (the account: one row per leg, naming the child it went to) —
 *  exactly the shape REC-14's `completeness` / `completeness_excluded` pair
 *  takes, for exactly the same reason.
 *
 *  WHY THE APPORTIONMENT IS A GATE AND NOT MERELY AN OP BEHAVIOUR. R4's whole
 *  argument is that division and severance do not substitute, because
 *  *"every leg gets a home… Neither is not"*: severance REMOVES material from a
 *  question, division only RE-HOMES all of it. The abuse it blocks is that
 *  dividing would otherwise be a cheaper way to shed a finding that CUTS
 *  AGAINST you than severing it. That protection is worth nothing if it lives
 *  only in the op — a hand-written document could then wear `divided` while
 *  quietly dropping the inconvenient leg — so the requirement is that EVERY
 *  ORD in basis[] is accounted for. Ord, not target: duplicate targets are
 *  legal by design (D4 — one document, two legs), and keying on the target
 *  would let one row discharge two legs.
 *
 *  NO PER-LEG REASON (DEC-29). One authored reason for the whole division; the
 *  per-leg judgment is recorded per leg IN THE APPORTIONMENT ITSELF, and the
 *  counterweight to the friction asymmetry with severance is DISCLOSURE, not
 *  ceremony. Nothing here should be read as an invitation to add one. */

 *  governs `basis[]` and C-25.10 governs `basis_version_legs[]`; they are two

/** REC-42 / DEC-32: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGS, and the act that asserts it.
 *
 *  Bob ruled the arithmetic: *"sometimes the weakest is the claim's strength,
 *  and other times it's not. The difference is really whether the relationship
 *  between legs is AND or OR."* So a leg may name a GROUND, legs sharing a
 *  ground are AND-related (the ground is no stronger than its weakest leg), and
 *  the grounds are OR-related (the finding is as strong as its STRONGEST
 *  ground, because each is independently sufficient for the same conclusion).
 *
 *  THIS FUNCTION EXISTS BECAUSE OR TAKES THE MAXIMUM. Every other grammar arm
 *  in this file guards a claim that can only be as strong as what it rests on;
 *  a ground label is the one thing a member can write that makes a finding
 *  STRONGER. DEC-32's anti-gaming keystone is therefore a correctness
 *  requirement rather than a preference: **an unstructured basis stays
 *  weakest-leg, and independent sufficiency is only ever reached by an
 *  AFFIRMATIVE, ATTRIBUTED act.** Hence the `grounds[]` block — one row per
 *  label, carrying the NAME of the member who asserts that ground stands on its
 *  own and the DATE they asserted it, which is the same accountability shape as
 *  the conclusion itself. A label with no row is refused: strengthening by
 *  omission, by default, or by a member not understanding a question is exactly
 *  what must be impossible.
 *
 *  TWO TOP-LEVEL KEYS, forced by the restricted frontmatter grammar rather than
 *  chosen: `ground` is a scalar ON THE LEG (the partition) and `grounds` is an
 *  array of objects (the act), because the grammar cannot carry a map holding an
 *  array of objects. Exactly REC-14's `completeness`/`completeness_excluded` and
 *  REC-16's `division`/`division_apportionment` split, for the same reason.
 *
 *  THE PARTITION IS TOTAL OR ABSENT. If ANY leg names a ground, EVERY supporting leg
 *  must (R68: a leg that cuts against is never in a ground, and naming one there is refused). A half-labelled basis would leave legs nobody grouped sitting beside
 *  branches somebody did, and the honest reading of an unlabelled leg —
 *  necessary, so binding on every branch — is not what a member who labelled
 *  half a basis is likely to have meant. Refused here rather than guessed. (The
 *  derivation still treats an unlabelled leg as NECESSARY if one ever reaches it
 *  around this gate; the arithmetic's default is AND too, and the two defences
 *  are separate on purpose.)
 *
 *  WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. No per-ground FALSIFIER: DEC-32 is explicit
 *  that minting one per ground reads as more honest and is less — it converts
 *  one checkable compound falsifier (*every ground fails*) into several partial
 *  ones, none of which refutes the finding. No per-ground grade: a ground's
 *  strength is DERIVED from its legs and never authored. And no AND/OR
 *  vocabulary reaches any member-facing surface — that is UI-27's elicitation
 *  half, which asks the member about CONSEQUENCES and derives this structure
 *  from their answers.
 *
 *  Q14's contradiction case stays SEPARATE and UNDESIGNED: grounds AGREE on the
 *  conclusion, and two conclusions disagreeing is a different thing entirely.
 *  Nothing here should be read as modelling it. */

       DEC-65's SINGLE-PART LICENCE STOPS ONE LEVEL UP, AND THIS IS A CLOSURE
       DECIDED RATHER THAN A SITE MISSED (PL-19, 2026-08-09). C-25.6 —
       `basisVersionFindings`, the identical question over a VERSION's ground
       rows — now accepts PL-17's explicit no-claim value on a version declaring
       exactly one part, because a MACHINE composes versions and would otherwise
       have to sign a member's name to one. THIS block governs the INQUIRY's own
       `grounds[]`, and it has NO machine writer to protect: `inquiry`'s
       `#ground` is the only act that writes these rows and it refuses a
       machine credential OUTRIGHT, before anything else, inside its own DEC-49
       region (`MACHINE_CANNOT_GROUND`, REC-64 / C-32.8). MEASURED at that op,
       not assumed from this file.
       So there is nothing here for the third state to keep honest, and admitting
       it would widen what the record may hold for a population that cannot
       produce it — which is the quiet widening DEC-65's own licence and PL-17's

/** REC-18 / DATA-MODEL D1(b) / DEC-15: THE EARNED RULE, PER AXIS.
 *
 *  A grade a caller can hand us is a grade a caller can invent, and CLAUDE.md
 *  is explicit that such a thing is not evidence. So the two grades the RECORD
 *  can compute for itself are computed by the record, and a leg claiming one
 *  must state the value the record actually holds — refused otherwise, in
 *  EITHER direction. Not "no stronger than", which is `inherited`'s rule and is
 *  right there because DEC-12 gives the member a real choice (which edition to
 *  rest on) and a weaker grade can be an honest consequence of it. There is no
 *  such choice here: an earned grade is a FACT about the record at the moment
 *  of the write, and a leg stating anything else states a non-fact about how it
 *  was established, which is precisely what grade means (SB-EVIDENCE 602-607:
 *  "grade tracks how the bytes reached us, never how credible the document is").
 *
 *  THE SPLIT THIS ENFORCES, and it is the recogniser precedent moved up one
 *  layer (schema.mjs:739-743 — "the RECOGNISER never mints a D; the model holds
 *  it so a member can testify, never the machine"):
 *    - `resolution`  EARNED, connection axis, A/B/C — the strongest resolution
 *                    of that document's captures to the inquiry's SUBJECT
 *                    ENTITY. Never D: a D resolution is itself a member's
 *                    testimony (op=resolvetestify), so a leg resting on one is
 *                    testimony and says so, with its own author and date.
 *    - `capture`     EARNED, capture axis — what the record holds about how the
 *                    bytes arrived. B for a document this instance captured;
 *                    A is not reachable and is refused by name, because a
 *                    chain-of-custody web archive is out of a Worker's reach
 *                    and is not claimed (CAPTURE-FIDELITY.md, R2-e/R2-g).
 *    - `testimony`   a MEMBER'S act, always D, author and date carried.
 *    - `hunch`       a member's act, authored above D, HUNCH DEBT until cleared
 *                    (DEC-15) — and the earned path is what it is cleared INTO.
 *                    D-188: HUNCH debt, not "bias debt". Ordinary bias debt is
 *                    DISCLOSED and travels; the hunch is the kind that refuses
 *                    publication (DEC-20).
 *
 *  THE SUBJECT-ENTITY PRICE IS REAL AND IS STATED (DEC-15). An inquiry that
 *  names no subject entity has no A/B/C available to it on the connection axis.
 *  That is not a gate to be got past by inventing one: the leg states no grade,
 *  the axis suspends and names it (R1), and the case reads as what it is.
 *
 *  AN ABSENT REGISTRY IS NOT A WAY THROUGH, and the posture is checkInheritedLeg's
 *  exactly: the pure checker over a filesystem cannot see `resolutions` or
 *  `register`, so it says so rather than passing the leg. Every path a real
 *  caller has — the ratification gate and the store's own write path — injects
 *  the registry. */
/** MK-2 / D-184 / IC-142: THE TESTIMONY AXIS, AND THE §7 REFUSALS THAT FALL

 *                                 trust, and nothing — a second member's
 *                                 co-signature included — makes it more.
 *    testimony-grade-unearned     a testimony letter other than the one the

 *                                 mode, resolution's precedent).
 *    testimony-axis-source        a testimony-axis grade whose source is not a

 *                                 inherited): a resolution, a capture or a hunch
 *                                 is an account of something else.
 *    testimony-axis-unconfirmable the checker cannot read the register, so it
 *                                 cannot confirm the target IS an observation

 *                                 is not a way through).
 *    testimony-axis-not-authored  the target is not a member's authored
 *                                 observation. A publisher's document graded
 *                                 as testimony would be a captured source
 *                                 passing for a member's word — the other
 *                                 direction of the confusion §2 forbids.
 *    testimony-leg-capture-graded ANY capture-axis grade on a leg citing an
 *                                 authored observation, whatever its source:
 *                                 the capture axis measures reading a document
 *                                 in (DEC-21), which did not happen, and an A
 *                                 would be true of the bytes and read as
 *                                 strength the observation does not have.
 *
 *  WHAT DECIDES "AUTHORED" is the registry's `testimony` map, which
 *  `earnedBasisRegistry` builds from the REGISTER's `authored` flag — a flag
 *  only `op=testify` can set (C-53.8). Never the leg, never the document: a
 *  caller cannot make a target an observation by saying so.
 *
 *  WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT REFUSED: a CONNECTION-axis grade on a leg citing an
 *  observation. §7 does not list it, and §3 now RULES it (BOB #15, 2026-09-18,
 *  answering the design gap MK-2 named): a leg on an observation carries a
 *  connection grade graded exactly as any leg's, neither refused nor exempt —
 *  testimony says WHOSE WORD, connection says HOW DIRECTLY it bears, and with
 *  capture not applicable a refused connection grade would leave the leg
 *  invisible to the bar. This module's R4 test of a connection grade on an

     - mode 'value' (the CONNECTION axis): `resolutions` holds the grade itself,

       weaker letter is not modesty, it is a false statement about how the leg
       was established, which is exactly what a grade means.
     - mode 'ceiling' (the CAPTURE axis): the record holds whether it has bytes
       for this document and what the STRONGEST capture this plane can produce is
       worth — it does NOT hold a per-document capture grade, because no such
       column exists. So the rule is the honest half: no leg may claim MORE than
       the ceiling (which makes grade A structurally unreachable, per the
       doctrine), and a weaker grade is admitted as the member's account of a
       poorer route. The residual — that B-or-weaker is still authored — is

/** REC-14 / C-21.2: THE INHERITANCE RULE, PER AXIS.
 *
 *  A case built on a case cannot be stronger than the case beneath it. So a
 *  basis leg whose target is a PUBLISHED inquiry carries grade_source
 *  'inherited', NAMES THE EDITION it rests on, and carries a grade no stronger
 *  than that edition's FROZEN strength ON THE SAME AXIS — refused if stronger
 *  on either axis, and the two are compared independently.
 *
 *  PER AXIS IS THE WHOLE OF IT (RECONCILED R2-j). A single scalar comparison
 *  would let a case inherit an A CONNECTION grade from a case whose A was a
 *  CAPTURE grade — two incommensurable measurements over two different
 *  populations, laundered through one letter. The frozen pair is stamped in the
 *  published bytes as two axis OBJECTS for exactly this reason, and the axis
 *  the leg selects is its own recorded grade_axis.
 *
 *  AN UNRATED OR UNDETERMINED AXIS ADMITS NO GRADE AT ALL, and the two say
 *  different things. UNRATED means nothing on that axis was ever established —
 *  a grade inherited from it would be invented outright. UNDETERMINED means the
 *  walk could not finish, so what lies beneath is UNKNOWN rather than absent,
 *  and a grade taken from it would be a claim about material nobody has seen.
 *
 *  THE EDITION DOES NOT SILENTLY FOLLOW (DEC-12). A leg citing edition 1 keeps
 *  citing edition 1 when edition 2 appears; REC-17's re-evaluation obligation
 *  surfaces the newer edition and the MEMBER decides. Nothing recomputes a
 *  strength on their behalf, because the strength was not changed for them. */

 * (`strength`, K1447 (i), (ii)). So a leg on either names it and states no grade, axis or source of its own, and no

 * as it refuses any id that is not a bundle's; the occurrence is not a thing the record holds a row for until it is

 * T41-13 (D59; K2448, K2472, K2474, K2479) — A BIAS STATEMENT APPLIED AT A LEG (R18).
 *
 * A member reading a leg through the project's declared bias may record that a statement of that lens bore on it:
 * `[{statement, effect, from?, to?}]`. The record keeps the application beside the leg so a reader (and the standalone
 * checker, under a lens of its own) can see which statement moved what, and redo the reading without it.
 *
 * ONE ENCODING (K2479). A leg is an item of `basis[]`, and a list item holds scalars only (record-grammar R7), so the
 * list is written on the leg as numbered scalar keys, `bias_<n>_statement`, `bias_<n>_effect`, `bias_<n>_from` and
 * `bias_<n>_to`, `n` from 1 and contiguous, as R17 flattens a derivation. `flattenBiasApplied` writes it and
 * `readBiasApplied` reads it back; `basis-versions` R48 uses the same pair for a conclusion row. A `bias_applied` key on
 * a row is not the encoding and is refused, so the record holds one spelling of one fact.
 *
 * WHAT IS JUDGED HERE IS THE FORM AND NOTHING ELSE. `statement` is the statement's id as its lens holds it, the author's
 * own string (bias R16, R49; no minted form, K2474), so it is asked only to be a non-empty string a front-matter scalar
 * can carry (at most 200 characters, no quote, backslash, newline or `#`); whether it is in force for the inquiry's
 * project lens is `inquiry` R61's store-side check, since this module reads no record (R9). `effect` names what the
 * statement did: `grade_lowered` (with the `from` and `to` letters, a lowering), `leg_excluded` or
 * `inference_refused`. The shape is closed, at most 32 applications, no statement and effect twice.
 *
 * IT MOVES NO GRADE. The leg's stated grade is the member's and is judged by R4's arms exactly as without it; a
 * `grade_lowered` row is not compared with that grade, and nothing here derives one from the other.
