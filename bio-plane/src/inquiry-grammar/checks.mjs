/* inquiry-grammar — THE ROWS (requirements: `build/requirements/inquiry-grammar.md` R5, R7; DEC-49, K6).
 *
 * Each row is `{check, where, translation}`, its number and translation moved from the check catalogue
 * (`checks/bio-checks.mjs`, legacy-checks) unchanged. `LEAD_NOT_EVIDENCE` (C-54.1) is raised here, by
 * `leadLegFindings` (`./grammar.mjs`), and its `where` names that site (changed from the catalogue's; stamped by
 * 1.50.0, T20's layer 2). The other five are minted by `inquiry`'s acts (its R20, R11, R23, R27), which read them
 * from here; their `where`s name those acts' sites, unchanged. This file imports nothing. */

/* =====================================================================
 * MK-4 / IC-135 / IC-136 — THE LEAD (D-194, `MEMBER-KNOWLEDGE-DESIGN.md` §5):
 * the same member knowledge BEFORE the search. C-54, minted with the old
 * process's `node tools/mintid.mjs C` (that tool was retired in T19).
 *
 * ITS OWN FAMILY because its subject is its own: the ways a member's LEAD could
 * come to claim more than it is. §5 rules a lead is an authored row and NEVER
 * EVIDENCE — it cannot be a basis leg — and following it is a LOOK recorded in
 * `observation_log` under `authority_kind = 'lead'`. The observation log's own
 * refusals (C-22.x, `checkObservation` in `airun.mjs`) apply to that look
 * unchanged and are NOT restated here; what is here is the lead's own:
 *
 *   is-lead-not-evidence   THE REFUSAL THE ITEM EXISTS FOR (§7): a lead cited as
 *                          a leg, at every leg grammar, BY NAME
 *
 * THE LIAR THIS FAMILY REFUSES is a lead that is merely an UNLABELLED
 * OBSERVATION — stored as a bundle or a content row, so a leg could cite it as
 * evidence. The first fence is STRUCTURAL: a lead lives in `leads` under a
 * `LEAD-` id that no leg grammar accepts as a target or a content id. The second
 * is this family's C-54.1, which names the lead instead of answering "not a
 * canonical record id" — a member told their lead is malformed would re-author
 * it as a document, which is exactly the liar arriving by the front door.
