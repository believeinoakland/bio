/* actions — the Action object (requirements: `build/requirements/actions.md`; State Rules v1.5 §4.4): what the group
 * sends or does outside the system, to whom, why, under which laws, at what legal exposure, by when, and what came
 * back. A member decides every move; a machine prepares and never advances, testifies, sets a tier or states a law.
 *
 * Extracted from the legacy modules (T8, layer 9; K3, K4, K6, K23, K31, K57, K61, K64, K75 (2), K79, K102):
 * `store.mjs` (the clock rule, `#actionDerived`, `actionMove` … `#spliceCorrespondence`, the governing-laws fence, the
 * action, risk-tier and `responds_to` arms of the promotion step and its three projections, the purge list entries and
 * the dispatch) and `schema.mjs` (the four tables, now `./schema.mjs`). The legacy code's comments moved with it. The
 * action document's grammar, its arms, readers and rows are `action-grammar`'s (T19 layer 9), read from there.
 *
 * REACHED as `actionsOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host, created on the first call. At creation it creates
 * its tables and declares them to record-core's purge (R36), registers its check and projection with promotion (R1–R3,
 * R7, R11, R33), action-grammar's audit arm with record-core (R51), its facts and projection decoration with retrieval (R12,
 * R25; retrieval R53, R56), its "what we did" and trigger sources with events and duties (R66, R67), its none-exists
 * reader with intent (R71), and its own-act reader and own-sending check with consequences and standards (R97); and it
 * creates `action-records` (T47, N961; its R15), whose proposals, receipts, scopes and promises the read answers and
 * whose four judgments its acts ask (R18, R23, R64, R70; the getter `records`), whose `stakeOf` the read answers as
 * `own_stake` (R105) and whose `noSuchAction` this module re-exports (R107, R43). The
 * pressure marks and litigation holds, their reads and their registrations with doorbell and ratification, are
 * `action-holds`' since T45 (R48, R52, R54–R60, R69; K2781 (1)). `place()` and `zoneOf` give the group's zone to modules
 * with no office (R68); `actionZone` is the one zone an action's clock is read in (R100; `action-clocks` reads it).
 * `deps` (each reached through its factory on the same host unless given; a test passes its own):
 *   record, membership, promotion   layer 2: `transact`, `acquireLease`, `releaseLease`, `head`, `readFile`, `livePaths`,
 *                                   `declarePurge`, `registerAuditCheck`, `getSetting`, `bundleInfo`; `viewerPredicate`,
 *                                   `memberFacts`, `listenerRefusal` (R45, R94, R95); `promote`, `registerStep`.
 *   retrieval      `registerActionFacts`, `registerProjectionDecoration` (its R53, R56).
 *   content        `captureFor` (R11).
 *   conformance    `determinationRead` (R8, R30, R75, R76), when provided (see R8 below); its module-level
 *                  `determinationSuperseded` (its R20) and `determinationVoided` (its R33), through which R8 answers.
 *   entities       `readEntity` (its R5): whether an addressee's `entity_id` names a person, an office or an
 *                  organisation (R9, R77, R78).
 *   consequences   `successRecordRead` (its R20; R8 (e), R93), `registerOwnActReader` (its R19; R97).
 *   standards      `standardRead`, `inForceAt` (R64), `registerOwnSendingCheck` (its R53; R97).
 *   project-roster `projectScope` (its R23): a counsel matter's acts are never in R66's items.
 *   local-facts    `governingView` (its R12): the view of kinds, venues, records laws and statuses (R10).
 *   progressions  `readProgression` (its R5): the progressions and stages a records request's `seeks` names (R70).
 *   intent         `registerNoneExistsReader` (its R33): the reader of requests answered that none exists (R71);
 *                  `null` registers none.
 *   now            the instance clock, milliseconds (default: `env.BIO_NOW_MS`, else the wall clock).
 *   env            the instance bindings.
 *
 * READ CONTRACTS it joins in its own SQL: record-core's `bundles` (`bundle_id`, `object_type`, `current_state`) and
 * `files` (`bundle_id`, `path`, `content`), its R37; provenance's `register` (`capture_sha`, `bundle_id`), its R48;
 * connections' `refs` (`bundle_id`, `target_id`, `kind`) for R25's `responses`. */

  /* REC-24 (c): MOVING AN ACTION THROUGH ITS OWN STATE MACHINE — the first op
   * in this plane whose subject is an action at all.
   *
   * WHY IT EXISTS. `STATES.action` has carried five states and seven edges since
   * the catalog was written, and NOTHING wrote them: SB-OUTPUT §4 measured the
   * whole diagram as dashed, with the creation of the bundle the only node that
   * ran. An act the table permits and no caller can perform is the state machine
   * lying, which is exactly what REC-31 said about `deferred -> open`.
   *
   * THE EDGE TABLE IS THE CATALOG'S AND THERE IS NO SECOND COPY. This is the
   * NAMED hazard of this item, not a general principle: `op=dispose` held its own
   * literal copy of the disposition set until REC-10 rewired it, and the whole
   * cost of that copy was that the publication and the refusal could disagree
   * about what was legal. So legality here comes from `vocabFor(STATES, …)` over
   * the DECLARED object_type — the MAP RULE, sixth consulting site — and this
   * method contains no state list of its own. Grep it: NO string from the action
   * vocabulary appears in this method at all.
   *
   * CORRECTED 2026-08-05 (REC-39), and the old sentence is worth keeping as the
   * receipt: it read "the only strings from the action vocabulary in this file
   * below are the four RESOLUTIONS, which are C-2.10's and are imported nowhere
   * because they are checked by the catalog itself a moment later". Every clause
   * was true and the conclusion was wrong. Being re-checked downstream makes a
   * copy HARMLESS at the write; it does not make it one array. The refusal this
   * method returns carries `legal:` — the option set a surface renders — so the
   * copy was load-bearing on the way OUT even though it was redundant on the way
   * in, and a word changed in the catalog would have left this act offering the
   * old one. RESOLUTIONS is imported now.
   *
   * THE REASON IS REQUIRED AND NEVER PREFILLED, op=reopen's rule and for its
   * reason: an action moving is the group deciding to send something outside the
   * system, or deciding it is finished, and a move with no account of why cannot
   * be checked by anyone including its author. Nothing is derived, defaulted or
   * proposed.
   *
   * A NAMED MEMBER MOVES IT. The author stamp arrives from the session and a
   * machine credential's is `token:<class>`, refused BY SHAPE. This follows
   * MACHINE_CANNOT_CONCLUDE / _RELEASE / _REOPEN and it is the same judgement:
   * an action is the one construct that reaches OUTSIDE this system and touches
   * people who never agreed to be in it, so a scheduler must not be able to
   * advance one. A machine may surface, gather and prepare (D-78, DEC-24); it
   * may not decide that the group is now asking somebody for something.
   *
   * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it does not touch the clock. A clock entry
   * that has fallen past due is a REAL finding about the document (C-11.1) and
   * this op neither suppresses it nor quietly marks it met — that would be the
   * machine authoring the answer to the question the deadline asked. Overdue is
   * DERIVED on read (see #actionDerived) and what to do about it is the member's. */

   * different kinds of evidence and must not be able to be confused.
   *
   * AND THE NON-RESPONSE IS A FIRST-CLASS ENTRY (DEC-13). A refusal to reply is
   * a dated first-party fact about the body and is frequently the more useful
   * one, so it is RECORDED with the date it was due rather than left as an
   * absence a reader has to infer. It takes the testimony arm by construction:
   * nothing arrived, so there are no bytes to hash.
   *
   * THE PRODUCER OF `responds_to` IS HERE. A RECEIVED entry whose artifact
   * resolves to a bundle in this store writes a responds_to edge on THAT
   * document, pointing back at this action — the direction SB-OUTPUT's A10 row
   * specifies, and the reason the relation is no longer a string the vocabulary
   * merely tolerates. Idempotent: an edge already there is not written twice.
   *
   * D-148: A RECEIVED ENTRY MAY CARRY A QUOTE (`quote_amount`, `quote_currency`,
   * `quote_basis`, `quote_answers`, `quote_revises`). The rule is the catalog's
   * `quoteFindings`, run here over the ledger as it WOULD stand, so a member is
   * refused by the C-72 name before anything is written, and the same function
   * reports C-2.10 over the document that lands. An entry with no quote
   * parameter writes exactly the bytes it wrote before D-148.
   *
   * D-147: AND IT MAY CARRY ITS PLACE IN THE RECORDS-REQUEST LIFECYCLE (`stage`,
   * `follows`, `outcome`, `exemptions`, `due_by`, `due_cite`) — the catalog's
   * `lifecycleFindings`, run here the same way. A due date's citation is judged
   * HERE against the action's governing laws as they stand when it is stated
   * (DUE_CITE_NOT_GOVERNING), and only here: see the catalog's comment for why
   * the document-level rule does not. No due date is ever computed. An entry
   * with no lifecycle parameter writes exactly the bytes it wrote before. */

   *
   * *"ALL records laws apply."* The layers follow the AGENCY ASKED — federal FOIA governs federal agencies, the
   * CPRA a California state or local agency, and a city's sunshine ordinance adds its own — so a request carries
   * a LIST, each law named by CITATION and stated at its level. This act is how the list is set, and the ONLY

   * (GOVERNING_LAWS_REWRITTEN), so an action nobody stated a list for is undetermined IN ITS BYTES.
   *
   * A NAMED MEMBER SETS IT. The design: *set by a member's authored act; the machine may propose the list from
   * the counterparty, labelled as machine work, and never sets it*. So a machine credential is refused BY NAME
   * (MACHINE_CANNOT_SET_LAWS), the actionMove precedent. No proposal is built.
   *
   * THE WHOLE LIST, REPLACED. A member states the laws that govern the request as a set; adding one later is a
   * new statement of the set, attributed and dated anew, and the Session Log keeps what it replaced. There is
   * no act that clears it: an empty list is the undetermined state, and a member does not "set" it — nobody
   * having stated the laws is what it means.

   *  `risk_tier`): A MEMBER REVISES AN ACTION'S RISK TIER, AS AN AUTHORED, APPEND-ONLY ACT.
   *
   *  The tier carries legal exposure — 3 is "do not file without counsel" — so the record must show that it was
   *  changed, by whom, when and why. A member may revise ANY tier, up or down, and the act:
   *   - writes `risk_tier` through the one front-matter path every reader derives the tier from (`riskTierState`
   *     over the document's own bytes; `#projectRow`'s `action_risk_tier` column; `op=search q=risk:`);
   *   - APPENDS one entry to `risk_tier_history[]` — the tier set, the tier replaced (`prior`), who, when and the
   *     REQUIRED reason — and never edits or drops an earlier one, so the prior tier, its author and its reason stay
   *     readable (`riskTierHistoryOf`); `promote` refuses any other writer that changes either (C-90.1);
   *   - records the revision in the Session Log as well, as every act on an action does.
   *  A machine credential is refused by C-32.19's own code. The act states 1, 2 or 3: `undetermined` is what an
   *  action reads when nobody has assessed it, and a member does not "set" it — actionLaws' rule for an empty list.
   *  A revision to the tier already held is refused: it would append a change that is not one. What a machine may
   *  PROPOSE is REC-215's, read beside this history and never written into it. */
