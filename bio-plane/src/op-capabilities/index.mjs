 * would mean inventing a member who does not exist.

 * boundary.
 *
 * STRUCTURAL, not a hand list. Every mutating op a SESSION can reach appears
 * here, including the ones that need no capability, written as an explicit null
 * with the reason. op-declarations' R3 test (test/m/op-declarations/tables.test.mjs)
 * reads SESSION_OPS and this table as exported and fails on any session-reachable
 * mutating op that is missing,
 * AND on anything named here that no session can reach, so the table cannot rot

  /* REC-45: GROUPING RIDES `contribute` and NO NEW CAPABILITY TOKEN IS MINTED,

     Membership §5's four rights are the whole set and a fifth would need §5
     reopened; there is nothing here a fifth would express that `contribute`
     does not, because authoring the structure of a basis is a corpus write on a
     question and a view-only member does not perform one.

     THE ARGUMENT FOR A NARROWER GATE IS REAL AND IS REJECTED, and it is worth
     stating because this act raises a grade. One could argue that the act which
     makes a finding STRONGER deserves `publish`'s right, or an owner's. It
     would be the wrong mechanism twice over. First, `publish` gates the
     PUBLICATION, which is where a stronger grade actually reaches a reader, and
     it is untouched: a member may group their reasons all day and nothing
     leaves the record until somebody with `publish` authors a case. Second — and
     this is DEC-30's argument arriving from the other side — grouping is also
     the only route BACK to an ungrouped basis, so an owner-only gate would let
     an owner hold a structure in place that another member can see is an
     overclaim, and DE-ESCALATION MUST NEVER REQUIRE PERMISSION FROM SOMEONE
     WHOSE INCENTIVE MAY RUN THE OTHER WAY. What bounds misuse here is not a
     gate: it is the NAME on every group, the legs staying visible under it, and
     the frozen per-group breakdown a reader checks (DEC-32's three
     containments). The named-member requirement is enforced by the store on the
     author stamp, as release's, conclude's, reopen's and inquirydivide's are,

     on anything (§1's suggesting / authoring / committing, kept apart).

     `airuntick` and `airunclose` carry the SAME capability rather than none.
     The alternative — gate the open and leave the tick free — would mean a
     credential that may not start a run may still spend its budget and close
     it, which is the fence in the wrong place. The two READS are ungated by

     IS-6 shipped `contribute` as a PROVISIONAL and asked Bob which capability a
     run costs. He answered that it is not a capability question at all:
     *"AN INVESTIGATION CAN BE STARTED BY ANY MEMBER OF A PROJECT… the gate is
     PROJECT MEMBERSHIP, not a capability tier — participation in the project
     the inquiry belongs to is what licenses asking the system to look, and the
     spend rides on membership the group already governs."*
     So `contribute` STAYS HERE — unchanged, still enforced, and refusing in its
     own words with `needs` on the answer — while the real gate is participation
     in the project the run's context belongs to, checked in the store where the
     citation graph and the participation rows are, and refused with its own
     C-22.8 code and canned translation.
     **THE TWO REFUSALS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT ONE.** *You are not in this
     project* and *you lack contribute* are different facts about an account
     with different remedies — an owner of that project invites you, or an
     administrator grants a capability — and a single refusal covering both
     would tell a member nothing they can act on.
     The order is: this capability floor first (here, at the control plane),
     then participation (in the store). A member who fails both is told about
     the capability, because that is the refusal that fires first; neither
     answer is ever both. */
