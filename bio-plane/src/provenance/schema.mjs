 * the register and the acquisition receipts (`captured_locators`), with the comments that record why each is shaped
 * as it is; and the table this module added, the declared origins (R29). `register` and `captured_locators` are a
 * stated read contract (R48): later modules may join their capture digest, `bundle_id`, path, locator columns; every
 * write to them is this module's (R41). `provenance_route_marks` is `provenance-routes`' (its R12), and
 * `receipt_keys` and `signed_receipts` are `attestation`'s (its R10), each created and written by that module alone
 * under the same name (N512), so a deployed instance keeps their rows. */

-- capture hash and carries no locator, so nothing could answer "does the store
-- hold a capture of https://..." without this. One row per (address, capture),
-- because the point is precisely that an address is captured repeatedly over
-- time and the versions are what a contemporaneity verdict compares.
-- One row per (address, DISTINCT BYTES), carrying the INTERVAL over which those
-- bytes were seen served rather than a single date. That interval is the whole
-- point: identical bytes observed on both sides of another document's retrieval
-- prove the target did not change across it, which settles contemporaneity
-- outright and needs no timestamp from the source that anyone has to trust. A
-- first draft keyed rows by (address, sha) and kept only the earliest date,
-- which threw away exactly the evidence the verdict is built on.
-- D-96: via names the SOURCE of an observation, because once an alternative
-- source counts as a re-fetch for monitoring (RULED, AUTHORITY-AND-TRUST.md),
-- archive bytes and live bytes must never be compared as one observation
-- stream. Two sources agreeing is STRONGER evidence than one source repeating;
-- two sources disagreeing is not evidence of change at all. The bracket arm
-- cannot tell those apart without knowing which is which, so via is part of
-- the KEY: an archive observation of the same bytes is a different fact from a
-- direct one, not a repeat of it.
--
-- The address columns carry the DOCUMENT ADDRESS, the address the record
-- reasons about; retrieval_locator carries what was actually fetched. For an
-- archive capture the document address is the CDX original field through our own
-- normaliser and the retrieval locator is the archive's replay address, and
-- conflating them is how a provenance difference gets reported as a change.
--
-- CORRECTED 2026-09-14 BY CAP-8, AND THE OLD SENTENCE IS SAID RATHER THAN
-- DELETED. This read "For a direct capture they are the same string", and that
-- was true of every capture the plane could make until Bob ruled that a link to
-- a Google Drive file KEEPS THE LINK while the harvest is the OpenDocument
-- export. A Drive capture is via 'direct' -- we asked Google and Google answered
-- us, with nobody in between -- and its two addresses differ anyway: the address
-- columns hold the Drive link the source page carried, and retrieval_locator
-- holds the export address the plane composed from the file id and the kind.
-- So via no longer tells a reader whether the two are equal, and a reader that
-- wants the document address must read it here rather than infer it. IC-85.
