/* case-tensions — what a case says about the record after it is signed, and how a member's words are credited in it
 * (requirements: `build/requirements/case-tensions.md`; BIO_Publication_v0_1.md §3 rule 7, §4, §7;
 * MEMBER-KNOWLEDGE-DESIGN.md §4): which case editions a finding serves (R1), the flags raised when a pinned finding is
 * revised and their discharge (R2, R3), the tensions found after publication (R4), and the attribution level each
 * member chooses for their observation, or attested capture, in a case edition (R5–R7). `publication` calls it inside
 * its own acts; `queue-producers`, `review` and `ratification` read it.
 *
 * Split from `publication` by copy (K617, K1505; T33-62), no requirement changing meaning: `caseTensions`,
 * `caseRelation`, `flagCasesOnRevision`, `dischargeCaseFlags`, `caseFlags`, the attribution reads and act, with their
 * comments; the C-92 rows (`./checks.mjs`); the three tables they write (`./schema.mjs`). `publication`'s deletion job
 * (T33-63) deletes its copy, creates this module from its factory and registers the provider below.
 *
 * THE SEAM (K1505 (3), K31's pattern; `publication` R61). This module sits before `publication` (P4), whose tables
 * (`cases`, `published_case_members`, `published_cases`, `case_documents`) and splice (its R21, `reauthorSection`) the
 * moved code reads. It reaches them only through one provider `publication` registers at start
 * (`registerPublicationProvider`), whose doors answer exactly the rows the code read before the split:
 *   pins(bundleId, sha)              the roster rows pinning that sha: `[{case_id, edition, version_sha, role,
 *                                    project_id}]` by case and edition (R1, R2)
 *   preparations(bundleId)           the unsigned case documents whose text names it as a list entry: `[{case_id,
 *                                    edition, text, ratified}]`, `ratified` whether that case edition is (R1)
 *   caseDocument(caseId, edition)    `{case_id, edition, doc_sha, text, signed, project_id}` or null, as the plane (R4–R7)
 *   members(caseId, edition)         the edition's roster `[{bundle_id, version_sha}]` by its order (R4)
 *   latestRatified({project, after, limit})   each case's latest ratified edition `[{case_id, edition, project_id}]`,
 *                                    owned by `project` when given, in case id order after `after` (R4)
 *   signedDocumentsNaming(text, limit)   the ratified case documents whose text holds `text`: `[{text}]` (R5)
 *   reauthorSection(args)            `publication` R21's splice (R5, R7)
 * With no provider, R1 and R4 answer undetermined, R2 raises nothing, and R5/R7 refuse before writing.
 *
 * REACHED as `caseTensionsOf(host, deps)` (K61, K1563 (1)): one instance per host, created on the first call with
 * `deps`, returned to every later caller. At creation it creates its tables and declares them to record-core (R10),
 * registers with promotion the fact `caseMember` (R1) and its step's projection, the revision flag (R2).
 * `deps` (each reached through its factory on the same host unless given; a test passes its own):
 *   record, membership, promotion   layer 2: `head`, `readFile`, `declareTable`; `memberFacts`, `projectOwners`;
 *                                   `registerStep`, `registerFact`, the fact `producingGroup`.
 *   basisVersions  `testimonyReach` (R5's reach).
 *   contradiction  `unresolvedRecordOn` (its R29), for R4.
 *   capture        `captureAccountsOf` (R7's attesting member).
 *   now            the clock for the instants it writes when the caller gives none, an ISO string.
 *
 * READ CONTRACTS it joins in its own SQL: provenance's `register` (R5's author). */

   * forever and the working document has moved on.

   * TWO ARMS, BECAUSE PUBLICATION IS TWO ACTS.

   *   PINNED — the ratified relation. The roster row names this document's current `bundle_sha`; it exists only after

   *
   *   PREPARED — the window between `op=publish` and the signature, where the case exists in the bytes and NOWHERE
   *   ELSE: an unsigned case document naming this document at its CURRENT sha, in an edition not yet ratified. It is a
   *   REFUSAL INPUT ONLY: nothing here commits a case fact. Without it, a member could publish under one composed
   *   strength and ratify under another.
