/* acquisition — THE ACQUISITION ACT (R1–R47, R95–R98, R110–R112, its archives R38–R41, R45 and R48 in `unpack.mjs`; `build/requirements/acquisition.md`), split from `capture` (K617, K649 (1))
 * by copy of `capture/acquire.mjs` (K624 (1)), whose Rs it implements with their meaning unchanged: capture R1–R7, R9–R14,
 * R16–R20, R33–R36, R41, R42 and R60–R62 are this module's R1–R23 and R25–R28. It is reached in process (K72 (11)):
 * `capture`'s `acquire` and `archiveLookup` hand their own store in as `cap`, and the capture-request drain calls it
 * through its trusted arm (K58). It fetches, hashes and stores the bytes as they arrive, records the fetch as a receipt,
 * profiles what it is, captures a page's supporting files, requests co-attestation, and ANSWERS the provenance document a
 * caller promotes. It writes no bundle (R25) and it does not READ the document (R8): the reading is `extraction`'s.
 *
 * What `capture` keeps about sources and sites (reachability, site assets, links, sessions, the platform's ceiling, the
 * render allowance, the event queue, the validators) is reached ONLY through the store handed in; this module is earlier
 * in the order than `capture` and imports none of it.
 *
 * T35 (N688, F16, K1888): an archive this act captures is opened in the same call (R40; `unpack.mjs`, R38–R41), no fetch
 * goes to one of the group's own hosts (R42), and the co-archive is asked as the group or the member chooses (R20, R43).
 *
 * T50 (N1117, N1094): a member's `for` is recorded with the capture (R47), the member who parks a session is recorded with it
 * and listed by `openCaptures` (R19, R46), and every member-facing sentence is read by key from setup-words (plan rule 6).
 *
 * T51 fix round 2 (the walk's C5, C12, C13, C25): a capture held in parts is also kept whole under its own digest (`keepWhole`, R10),
 * co-attestation is waited for only briefly and recorded when it ends (R20), the render is a continuation the member finishes
 * (R5, R6, R12), and the document records the file name its source gave it (R16).
 *
 * T51 fix round 3 (the re-walk's C5, C12, C13, C25): a capture of several parts is kept whole from the parts held in memory,
 * once, with no read-back (R96); the trusted timestamp is waited for no set time (R20); the render arm asks the governor with
 * a peek and the fetch books the visit once (R97); the document carries its own title (R98, `title.mjs`).
 *
 * T51 fix round 5 (the second re-walk's E1, E5, E8, E10): a capture held in parts is profiled from the first KiB of its first part (R101);
 * `textTypeOf` is the one rule for reading a member's file as text (R102); `read` is split into download, hash and store (R103); a
 * visitor copy a member's "Finish it" finishes stays owed until its document is filed (R104).
 *
 * T51 fix round 6 (the third re-walk's G2, G3, G12a): a member's large or slow web capture is parked and owed to the plane's alarm, not read in the
 * request (`owedFetch`, R105); "Finish it" renders nowhere in the request (R106); a capture decided to be no archive is not decided again (R107).
 * Fix round 6 (G27, G32): a render that returns after its request has ended is kept in the evidence store at once and its reply dropped (`keepReply`, R5);
 * a caller in process hands the held capture's digest as `opts.heldSha` and the fetch is conditional for a member too (R22).
 *
 * T51 fix round 8 (the fourth walk's G103, G104, G105, G107): a member's open captures are matched by the member, in the door's form or her bare id, and a fetch made and not
 * yet delivered is still listed (`openCaptures`, R110); a delivery refused for a code no later try changes ends in words (`DELIVERY_FINAL`, R111); the render's keep of the
 * bodies its page loaded is inside the render's share of the bar (R112).
 *
 * Every refusal is an answer `{status, body}`, never a throw. The comments carried from the legacy handler keep the
 * reasoning beside the code it explains. */

 *  is fetched. A document made but not delivered is kept in the session (`fetch_done`) and delivered by the next run, never fetched
 *  twice. When the delivery is accepted the session is dropped (what the delivery records, `capture`'s `recordFetchDone`, is the
 *  caller's: it reads the session in `deliver`, before this drop). Answers `{ok: true, done}` (`done` ends the entry; a session that is gone is `done` with `reason` `NO_SUCH_SESSION`), `{ok: true, done: false,
