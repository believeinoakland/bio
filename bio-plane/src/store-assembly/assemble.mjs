/* store-assembly R1–R10, R99 (K5046 (a), K5052): THE ASSEMBLED STORE. `assembleStore(ctx, env, {deliver})` builds every
   module of the record store on one Durable Object's storage in the modules' order (R2), runs their migrations before
   any request (R3), hands the alarm to `scheduler`, and answers every store request through `store-door`'s `dispatch`
   over the one route map (R6, R7). It holds no construct of its own: no row but the owed-work ledger's, no refusal, no
   op (R97). It imports no platform module (R96), so it runs in plain node over a `node:sqlite` storage, which is how
   `storeWorld()` runs it (R90); `plane`'s `Store` hosts it as the Durable Object class and keeps the retirement of a
   room of another generation, the RPC methods, `alarm` and the headers. Copied, with its behaviour unchanged, from
   `plane/store.mjs`' constructor, `#migrate`, `routes`, `#dispatch`, `#nowMs` and `#ownNamespace` (K624: split by copy,
   then delete). The comments below keep the ids they were written under; each one's requirement here is the one that
   says "(was `plane` R<n>)". */
