/* store-assembly R84 (was plane R72; K4168, K4202): THE OPS THE ASSEMBLY ANSWERS ITSELF, declared as every owner declares
   its own (op-declarations R80, op-grades R49). `ask` is the door's arm in `ask.mjs` (`askOp`), `readtranslate` the draft
   path's (`draftOnObject`, kind `reading`), `owedwork` the owed-work ledger's read (`pending.mjs`); none has an ops map of
   its own to declare beside, so none is in R6's route map under this file. Each row is copied from the op's existing rows
   in `op-declarations` and `op-grades`, never chosen; the fields are what the arm reads. `plane` no longer declares them
   (its Wave B, K5201), so this is their one `DECLARED_OPS` (`declarations.mjs` registers it under `store-assembly`). */
