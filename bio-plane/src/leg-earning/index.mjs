/* leg-earning — what the record can earn for a leg of an inquiry's basis, and which questions rest on a target
 * (requirements: `build/requirements/leg-earning.md`). The earned registry (R1, R8, R9) and the cap a stated grade meets
 * (R2), the inquiry's earned basis as a viewer may read it (R3), the projected legs and the legs resting on a target (R4,
 * R5), the one walk that finds a cycle through inquiry legs (R6), the projects drawing on a question (R7; paged, R13;
 * as a viewer may be shown them, R14), and the table all of them read, `inquiry_basis`, with its one write (R12). T41
 * adds a passage of an AI transcription's capture ceiling (R15) and the authored note's route words (R16). It writes no
 * basis of its own and grades no conclusion: those are `inquiry`'s and `strength`'s.
 *
 * Split from `inquiry` by copy with no change of meaning (T33-44; K617, K1505): the code below is `inquiry`'s
 * `index.mjs` and `schema.mjs` as they stood at the split, its comments moved with it; `inquiry`'s job (T33-45) deletes
 * its copy and re-points its projection at `writeBasis`. New here: R8 (a held standard's text, K1447 (iii)) and R9 (a
 * duty occurrence, K1447 (i)).
 *
 * REACHED as `legEarningOf(host, deps)` (K61, K1563 (1)): one instance per host, created on the first call with `deps`,
 * returned to every later caller. At creation it creates its table and declares it to record-core (R12).
 * `deps`:
 *   record, membership, promotion, content   the modules it uses, through their factories on the same host unless a
 *                test passes its own.
 *   connections, entities, provenance, standards, duties   reached lazily, on first use, the same way.
 *   now          the module's clock, an ISO instant at second precision (default: the wall clock); R9's `asOf`. */

   *  REC-82 landed `ensureLegContent` as a pure function with NO CALLER and
   *  said so in its own suite rather than leaving the gap to be found. This is
   *  the caller: the first read that asks what a leg earns mints the
   *  `document` row a leg written before the column existed should always have
   *  had. Deterministic because the id is a hash, so it is a read that happens
   *  to write rather than a migration with a direction — running it twice, in
   *  two sessions, or after a replay produces the same id.
   *
   *  ONE TRANSACTION FOR THE WHOLE BASIS, not one per leg.
   *
   *  THE TWO LEGITIMATE NULLS COME BACK AS THEMSELVES AND ARE CARRIED, NEVER
   *  COLLAPSED (IC-83's AMENDMENT 2): an inquiry target has no capture and no
   *  part to point at (DEC-21), and a target the record holds no bytes of has
   *  nothing to address. `ensureLegContent` answers each with its own `why`,
   *  and this pass puts that sentence on the leg so every read that meets the
   *  null states WHICH it is.
   *
   *  BOUNDED, AND THE BOUND IS STATED IN THE ANSWER. A basis's leg count is
   *  unbounded by the schema and `ensureLegContent` does a small fixed number
   *  of reads per leg, so an unbounded backfill behind a member-callable read
   *  is REC-66's amplification arriving at a new door. It is capped, and a read
   *  that hit the cap says so and leaves the rest for the next read — safe
   *  precisely because the id is a pure function of the leg. R3's test
   *  (`test/m/leg-earning/earned-basis.test.mjs`) drives the bound over 51 legs and
   *  the next read's continuation. */

   *    `only_capture`  no pin, and the record holds exactly ONE capture of the document: there is only one
   *                    version the leg can rest on.
   *    `undetermined`  no pin, and the record holds SEVERAL captures. The leg's content row is about the

     *
     * THE READ IS NOT CAPPED, AND THAT IS A DECISION RATHER THAN A DEFAULT
     * (found when a first draft capped it at `CONTENT_EARNED_MAX`). This read is
     * over exactly the population the `asked` read three lines up already
     * enumerates UNCAPPED: the same table, the same bundle, one row per leg.
     * Capping one and not the other would publish two different populations in
     * one answer and silently omit legs whose targets are listed — the drift
     * this method's own comments warn about, installed by a bound nobody asked
     * for. A basis is bounded by what a member authored in one document, and the
     * answer says so by listing it whole. What IS bounded is the BACKFILL below,
     * because it WRITES; nothing inside a loop over these rows reads or writes
     * the store but through it.
     *
     * D-15, THE SAME POSTURE ONE OBJECT DOWN: a leg whose target the viewer may
