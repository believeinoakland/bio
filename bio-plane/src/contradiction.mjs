/* contradiction.mjs — REC-147 (CONTRADICTION-IDENTIFY-DESIGN.md §5, §8, §9 item 3): THE JUDGEMENT
 * OVER A FORMED PAIR, as the words a run is given, and the vocabulary its answer is held to.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS. §2 splits IDENTIFY in two: PAIRING is the plane's (op=contradictionpairs, REC-146), and
 * JUDGEMENT is the machine's, inside a run, labelled machine work, always a proposal (DEC-24). The plane cannot
 * judge, so what it holds of the judgement is (1) the PROMPT the run judges under, (2) the RENDERING of a formed pair
 * into §5's input (the two sides and their immediate context, nothing else), and (3) the LABELS an answer may carry,
 * which op=contradictionpropose refuses outside of. The model is the run's (§5's Incomplete note: the model, prompt
 * and packaging are the build's).
 *
 * THE PROMPT IS PINNED BY ITS DIGEST, NOT BY ITS WORDS. M-162 measured THIS prompt, byte for byte (its sha256 is
 * JUDGEMENT_PROMPT_SHA256 below), on M0-71's gate. A prompt edited without a new measurement is a detector that
 * never passed the gate, so test/m/contradiction/gate.test.mjs (R2, R57) fails when the two part: re-measure,
 * record the figures in a new measurement, and move the digest in the same commit (§7: a detector above the
 * threshold does not reach a member).
 *
 * THE PROMPT WAS WRITTEN FROM §5 ALONE, before the corpus text was read, and was not edited after (M-162 says what
 * was removed from its draft and why: one line named a miss M-118 records, which would have been tuning to the
 * fixture). It carries Bob's own §7 example ("reduced a little" / "dropped a lot") because §7 quotes it as the
 * definition of precision, and the corpus carries that example too, so that one pair is NOT blind (M-162).
 *
 * A SKILL MAY NEVER HOLD A GATE (kickoffs/SKILL.md). Nothing in the prompt is a fence: the label vocabulary is
 * refused at op=contradictionpropose (C-93), the pair must be one the plane FORMED for that viewer (C-93), and a
 * re-run over unchanged referents writes nothing (the table's key). A model that ignored every word here could
 * propose a wrong label and nothing else. */

export const JUDGEMENT_PROMPT = `You are judging CANDIDATE CONTRADICTIONS for a civic research record. For each pair below, a deterministic pairing
put two assertions side by side for a stated reason (its KEY). You propose ONE label per pair. A member of the group
will see your proposal and decide; you decide nothing.

KEYS (why the two were paired):
- K1: two SOURCES one inquiry rests on, one cited as supporting and one as cutting against it.
- K2: two claims our group HOLDS, on two inquiries about the same subject.
- K3: two claims our group HOLDS, both resting on the same source passage (given as context).
- K4: two SOURCES about the same entity, of different document kinds or dates (each side's doctype/date given).

LABELS — exactly one per pair:
- world: the two SOURCES say incompatible things about the same matter (e.g. a rule requires X and the record shows
  the body did not-X; a body said X at one date and the contrary at another). Only for source sides (K1, K4).
- record: two things our group HOLDS cannot both be true. Only for held claims (K2, K3).
- precision: the same fact stated at different precision or with different emphasis — rounded vs exact figures,
  "approximately N" vs a stated number, a summary vs the table it summarises, "reduced a little" vs "dropped a lot".
  NOT a contradiction.
- unrelated: the two are not about the same matter after all (same entity, different subject).
- undetermined: you cannot tell from what is shown. Use it honestly; never force a label.

RULES:
- A FALSE CONFLICT IS THE WORST ERROR. Label world/record only when both statements cannot be true at the same time
  about the same matter. Differences of wording, rounding, emphasis, or vague magnitude are precision.
- Two statements at DIFFERENT DATES can both be true if the thing changed; that is world only when the later source
  contradicts what the earlier one says held (e.g. a body stating X, then stating not-X about the same thing), or
  a rule is contradicted by an act. Read dates and doctypes when given.
- Read figures, units and dates carefully, in full.
- Do not assign a CAUSE (misquote, opinion, double-speak) — only the label.
- Use only what is shown. Do not assume facts not in the two sides and their context.

OUTPUT: a JSON array, one object per pair, in input order: {"n": <pair number>, "label": "<label>", "reason": "<one sentence>"}.
Output the JSON only.

- For K1-K4 pairs: time_or_occasion, scope, meaning, observer_or_method, subject.
- For K5 pairs (two projects' conclusions on one question): scope, time_or_occasion, standard, evidence_set,

RULES:
- Name only respects from the pair's own list. Never say which side is wrong. Never name a kind of conflict
  (misquote, error, double-speak, reversal, a conflict of norms). Never assign a cause.
- Name a respect only when something SHOWN in the two sides suggests they differ in it (e.g. different dates or
  occasions; one about a part and one about the whole; a word used in two senses; two methods or observers; two
  different subjects under one name). Give one sentence saying what you saw.
