/* R47, R97 (DEC-109; H17; K1038; K405): WHO REALLY CONTROLS YOUR TEAM'S CIVICSMITH, told to the founder before they choose
   a password, in the design's words. This leaf imports nothing, so it cannot read the word list: each text below is the
   English of a word-list row, and `keys` names the row each is the twin of (`heading`, `sentences` in order, `guide`'s
   `sentence` and `name`). The plane's screens read the rows through `setup-words` (`screens-entry` R4, R6); the installer's
   last screen cannot, and shows these texts as the installer's own words (installer R34). A text equals its row's `en`
   exactly, and a word changed in the table is changed here in the same edit: this leaf is the one place a wording
   change is not an edit of the table alone. Nothing asks for or records an acknowledgement of the block. `guide` (T35;
   F10, K1874) is the block's last sentence, naming the guide to replacing the one-time password and where it is found,
   the same words for the setup screen and the installer.
   `hostingControlBlock(cls, {guideHref})` is the block as HTML, every word escaped, in an element whose class is the
   caller's own; with `guideHref` (a screen's address of the guide) the guide's name is a link to it, and without (the
   installer's) it is text; with `deployer: true` (the installer's last screen, K3240) the deployer's steps follow. */
