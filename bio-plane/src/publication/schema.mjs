-- The published projection: the ONLY tables the public doorbell reads.
-- Nothing lands here except through ratification, so answering a public
-- query from these tables can never leak working material. published_shas
-- is append-only across re-ratifications: a hash once published stays
-- verifiable forever, which is what a document holder needs.
--
-- REC-14 / DEC-12: KEYED (bundle_id, edition) AND APPENDING. The table used
-- to be keyed on bundle_id and to UPSERT, so re-ratifying destroyed the prior
-- signature, attestor, time and gate version (D-144) while published_shas
-- accumulated -- the code split against itself, and neither branch of the
-- terminality question. Bob's ruling makes the append RIGHT and the upsert
-- merely not yet edition-aware: an edition is a SEPARATE DOCUMENT, edition 2
-- joins edition 1 rather than overwriting it, and a reader who relied on
-- edition 1's hash is not betrayed because edition 1 still answers, still
-- carries its own attestation and its own date, and still says what it said.
--
-- title is the ONE deliberate divergence from DATA-MODEL.md 2.4.4, so the
-- public index is not N+1. The frozen columns after it are what the group
-- SIGNED, kept beside the signature rather than only inside the bytes:
-- strength is the frozen axis OBJECTS, one per axis of Store.STRENGTH_AXES --
-- capture and connection always, and testimony only when it carries something
-- (MK-2 / IC-142, corrected from "BOTH" by D-423) -- never letters: unrated and
-- undetermined are different frozen facts, and C-21.2 compares per axis
-- against the right one. required is DEC-17's declared bar as it stood,
-- null meaning ABSENT and gating nothing.
--
-- REC-44 / DEC-44 / D-187: THIS ROW IS A **FINDING**, NOT A CASE, and the
-- correction is that it was only ever a case by assumption. A published case
-- is a CONTAINER OVER ONE OR MORE FINDINGS scoped to the project's own
-- question; the FINDING stays the unit of truth and the CASE becomes the unit
-- of publication. So THREE things left this table and went to
-- published_cases, and each one left for the same reason -- it is a fact
-- about the CASE and would otherwise be stated once per member finding, which
-- is D-21's second place to state one fact:
--   completeness  the assertion C-21.1 compares the next edition against.
--                 C-21.1 is now PER CASE PER EDITION; C-21.2's per-axis
--                 inheritance stays PER FINDING and reads strength below.
--                 The two live at different altitudes and collapsing them is
--                 exactly what DEC-44 forbids.
--   manifest      DEC-34's signed hash manifest, which now describes the
--   manifest_sha  WHOLE case -- every member finding's parts, every member's
--                 own signature -- because a stranger holding the container
--                 must be able to check every finding the case rests on
--                 without contacting this instance (DEC-44 determination 3).
-- edition here IS the CASE edition the finding was published in, not a
-- number of its own: editions are over the CONTAINER (DEC-12, unchanged by
-- DEC-44 and given its natural home by it).
--
-- parts is WHAT THIS SIGNED EDITION OF THIS FINDING CONSISTS OF -- the path,
-- sha256, kind and byte length of every file, as hashed at ratification. It is
-- a column rather than a query over published_shas because published_shas is
-- append-only ACROSS editions on purpose (a hash once published answers
-- forever), so it cannot say which parts belong to WHICH edition, and the case
-- container needs exactly that: assembling edition N of a case means gathering
-- edition N's parts from every member, including members ratified minutes
-- earlier. Nothing else holds it.
--
-- REC-128 (BOB #14, the honesty half of D-421): attestor_member is who SIGNED,
-- taken from the signature. delivered_by is who DELIVERED it, taken from the
-- authenticated session that performed the act -- member:<id>, or founder for
-- the instance founder's password session. They are two facts and neither is
-- ever copied from the other. NULL is a row written before the column existed
-- and reads back as UNDETERMINED, stated, and is never back-filled from the signer.
-- case_documents carries the same column for op=caseratify, for the same reason.

-- calls) from the RATIFIED BYTES' own references[] and division disclosure --
-- never from a caller and never from the working refs table, which changes
-- under the published record every time somebody promotes.
--
-- TWO DISCLOSURE CLASSES, and the distinction is the whole table:
--
--   serve  the target is ITSELF published, so the public surface may hand over
--          its edition, its title and its bundle_sha, and a reader can fetch
--          those bytes by hash. Restricted to published targets, which is what
--          stops the published graph naming working material.
--   name   the id may be NAMED and nothing more. R4's disclosure obligation --
--          "a published child names its parent and its siblings" -- lands here,
--          and it had to: a divided parent is TERMINAL and can never be
--          published, and a sibling may not be, so BUILD-ORDER's original
--          "restricted to targets that are themselves published" made R4's
--          disclosure impossible on the exact surface R4 was written for
--          (RECONCILED R4-e/R4-g). A name row carries an id and nothing else --
--          no title, no state, no sha, nothing fetchable.
--
-- The published column is the instant the edge was published, exactly as in
-- published_shas. The PK is (from_bundle, to_bundle, kind) as specified, so a
-- second edition re-asserting the same edge is idempotent rather than doubled;
-- the class of an existing row is refreshed on re-publication, because whether
-- a target is published is a fact about the record and not about the edition.
--
-- DERIVED, and therefore in BOTH arms of op=purge (D-113) unlike its published
-- siblings: every row here is recomputable from bytes that answer forever
-- (published_shas keeps the case's own bundle.md, which carries references[]
-- and the division disclosure inside the hash the group signed), so a purge
-- that cleared it destroys an index and never a fact. published_bundles and
-- published_shas are exempt precisely because nothing else holds what they hold.

-- REC-44 / DEC-44 / D-187: THE PUBLISHED CASE, which is the object this record

-- scoped to the project's own question. Before this table a case WAS an
-- inquiry, and nobody chose that: it was assumed by every item in the chain,
-- and DEC-32 closed the only escape (a parent inquiry citing children would
-- collapse several propositions into one conclusion with one falsifier, the
-- overclaim DEC-32 exists to prevent).
--
-- THE IDENTITY IS DISTINCT FROM A BUNDLE ID, ALWAYS, including for the
-- one-finding case DEC-44 determination 5 keeps legal. Reusing the member's
-- bundle id when there happens to be one member is exactly the conflation
-- D-187 records: it would make ?id= ambiguous at the public read path and it
-- would make the shape depend on the arity, so the degenerate case would stop
-- being degenerate the moment a second finding joined. The id is minted by
-- op=publish (CASE-<year>-<seq>, through allocId like every other minted
-- identifier) and then CARRIED IN THE SIGNED BYTES of every member finding, so
-- a case identity can never be claimed at the commit that was not inside the
-- hash the member signed -- the rule DEC-12 already imposes on the edition.
--
-- WHAT IS AUTHORED HERE, and both are authored per CASE per EDITION:
--   scope         DEC-44 determination 2 -- Bob's "sufficient scope to address
--                 all issues that brought the various inquiries together".
--                 NEVER derived from the findings' titles. It sits BESIDE the
--                 completeness assertion and does not replace it: completeness
--                 says what was left OUT, scope says what the case is ABOUT,
--                 and a reader needs both because they are not the same claim.
--   completeness  REC-14's assertion, moved up one altitude. C-21.1's
--                 byte-check compares THIS against the previous edition of
--                 THIS CASE. The scope statement is deliberately NOT under
--                 that byte-check, and the reasoning is at C-21.1's site.
--   bias_acknowledgement
--                 REC-47 / DEC-46 (a). The publisher's AUTHORED acknowledgement
--                 of the bias this edition's case was produced under -- fresh
--                 per edition, never prefilled, and UNDER C-21.1's byte-check
--                 alongside completeness rather than exempt alongside scope.
--                 The discriminator between the two rules is recorded once, at
--                 C-21.1's site, because these three fields now sit side by
--                 side under two different rules and the next reader will ask.
--                 DEC-20 is why this is a DISCLOSURE and not a gate: ordinary
--                 declared bias never blocks publication and travels with every
--                 published case. Only an uncleared HUNCH disqualifies, and
--                 that refusal is publishpreflight's (UNCLEARED_HUNCH), not
--                 this column's. This field states the lens; it never judges it.
--                 The bias MANIFEST -- computed and stamped, DEC-46's other
--                 half -- is NOT here and is not built: the bias object type
--                 is still absent from the check catalogue (D-84), so no
--                 bundle exists to compute one from. The two are different
--                 things travelling together, and only the AUTHORED half of
--                 the pair can be built today.
--
-- ratified_at is NULL until the edition is COMPLETE -- until every member
-- finding has been ratified. That is a real state and it is stated rather than
-- hidden: each finding carries its own signature over its own bytes (the
-- finding is the unit of truth), so a case edition exists from the first
-- ratification and can only be SERVED as a container once the last one lands.
-- CASE-5 / DEC-72 clause 2 ADDS bar -- THE STANDARD OF EVIDENCE, STORED WHERE
-- IT IS A PROPERTY OF. Bob: "the bar -- that is, the standard of evidence -- is
-- a property of a project, not an inquiry or claim", told to the publishing act
-- at act time. CASE-2 computed it correctly and then had nowhere case-side to
-- put it, so the only place it was reachable was published_bundles.required --
-- once PER MEMBER.
--
-- THAT IS NOT A TIDINESS COMPLAINT AND THE DEFECT IT LEAVES IS REACHABLE. The
-- bar is read from the publishing project AT ACT TIME and members ratify at
-- DIFFERENT times, so a project whose bar moved between the first member's
-- ratification and the last one gave a single case edition TWO standards of
-- evidence, each stamped into different members' signed bytes, with nothing in
-- the plane noticing. Stored here it is ONE fact about the case, committed from
-- the signed bytes like the scope beside it and under the SAME divergence
-- refusal (CASE_ASSERTION_DIVERGED) -- so two members who signed different bars
-- are refused rather than reconciled.
--
-- JSON, matching the shape op=publish already stamps into every member's
-- required_strength block: declared, source, project, capture, connection,
-- detail. Not six columns, because it is ONE authored answer read at ONE
-- instant, and splitting it would let five sixths of a bar be written.
--
-- NULLABLE, and NULL is the honest answer for every edition published before
-- this column existed. A backfill from any member's required would look
-- defensible and would be an invention: it would assert that the case was held
-- to that standard when what the record actually holds is one member's stamp,
-- and where the two members disagree the backfill would have to choose which
-- disagreement to publish as the group's.

-- and the difference between them is what "this edition is not complete yet"
-- means. That difference is also why this is a TABLE rather than a derived
-- query over published_bundles, and it earns itself on the D4/REC-42 test
-- twice over: it needs an ORDINAL (the order the member published the findings
-- in is the order the container's parts[] and every rendering take, and it is
-- authored rather than alphabetical), and it answers a query keyed on it in
-- BOTH directions -- "which findings are in this case edition" (assembling the
-- container) and "which case does this finding belong to" (the public read
-- path resolving a finding id, which is why bundle_id is indexed).
-- CASE-1 / DEC-72 ADDS THE TWO FACTS A MEMBERSHIP ROW WAS MISSING: WHICH VERSION
-- OF THE FINDING IS IN THE CASE, AND WHAT THE PUBLISHER SAID IT WAS DOING THERE.
-- The design's member is (finding id, version hash, role, ordinal); before this
-- item the first and the last were here and the middle two were not.

-- version_sha -- CLAUSE 3, publication pins versions LIKE A COMMIT. Bob: "Once
--   published, the act of changing the findings (or any claims of any of the
--   findings) results in the changed version becoming a new version." The pin is
--   the finding's own bundle_sha, which is the hash the member SIGNED, so the
--   member row names a version by the same identity the signature covers.
--   NO SECOND COLUMN FOR THE MEMBER'S OWN EDITION NUMBER, deliberately: a
--   version is identified by its hash, and published_bundles is keyed
--   (bundle_id, edition), so resolving a pin is a PK-prefix seek on that
--   finding's own handful of editions rather than a scan. A stored edition
--   number beside the hash would be a second way to say the same thing, and the
--   two would eventually disagree. It also names the conflation the artifact
--   flip removes: before CASE-5 #caseEditionState read published_bundles at the
--   CASE'S edition number, which is only correct while one case owns one finding.
--   CASE-5 LANDED THAT FLIP 2026-09-10 -- resolution is now BY THIS COLUMN, and
--   the old predicate survives ONLY as the fallback for a row written before
--   CASE-3, whose pin is honestly NULL. edition on this table is the CASE'S
--   and a member's own edition is published_bundles', and after the flip the two
--   genuinely differ: a finding joining a case at that case's edition 2 having
--   published once before is at ITS OWN edition 1 inside the case's edition 2.
--
-- role -- CLAUSE 4, and it is AUTHORED BY THE PUBLISHER, never derived. Bob:
--   "All load-bearing findings of a case being published must meet the necessary
--   bar. Other findings/claims that don't meet the bar can be a part of the
--   published work, though they aren't presented as load-bearing." Two values and
--   nothing else: 'load_bearing' and 'supporting'. Spelled snake_case to match
--   every other closed vocabulary in this schema ('cuts_against' is the exact
--   precedent -- a hyphenated English term stored with an underscore), and the
--   spelling is fixed HERE so CASE-2 and CASE-6 do not each invent a third.
--
-- BOTH ARE NULLABLE AND THERE IS NO DEFAULT ON EITHER, WHICH IS THE WHOLE
-- DISCIPLINE OF THIS PAIR. Rows written before DEC-72 pinned no version and
-- carry no authored designation, and NULL states exactly that -- the same answer
-- inquiry_basis_versions.affirmed_parts gives, and for the same reason: a
-- DEFAULT of 'supporting' would mean a member could be designated by OMISSION,
-- and a default of 'load_bearing' would have the record assert that evidence
-- meets a bar nobody claimed it met. A designation that can happen without an
-- act is not authored. CASE-2 makes both REQUIRED AT THE DOOR, where a refusal
-- can name what is missing, rather than here where a constraint would only
-- break the shipped ratify path.

-- CASE-1 / DEC-72: THE CASE IDENTITY, AND WHOSE PRODUCTION THE CASE IS.
--
-- Bob, 2026-08-10, ruling the model this table exists to make structural: a case
-- is A PRODUCTION OF A PROJECT -- its own object, a set of finding-versions plus
-- the publishing project, published by a project OWNER against THAT PROJECT'S bar
-- at act time. The design is CASE-AS-PRODUCTION.md and it is the authority.
--
-- WHY THIS IS A THIRD TABLE RATHER THAN A COLUMN ON published_cases, and it is
-- the one structural decision in this item. published_cases is keyed
-- (case_id, edition). A project_id on THAT row would be a project per EDITION,
-- which permits edition 1 to be project A's production and edition 2 to be
-- project B's -- and under DEC-72 that is not a case with two editions, it is
-- two different productions wearing one identity. The bar is read from the
-- publishing project at act time, so a case whose owner can change between
-- editions is a case whose STANDARD OF EVIDENCE can change without anyone
-- authoring the change. One row per case_id makes that unrepresentable rather
-- than merely discouraged.
--
-- project_id IS NOT NULL, AND THE ABSENCE OF A ROW IS THE HONEST STATEMENT FOR
-- EVERY CASE PUBLISHED BEFORE THIS MODEL. DEC-72 removes the project-less
-- publication path outright, so a row here that named no project would be
-- exactly the shape the ruling deletes. Cases already in published_cases were
-- published under the pre-DEC-72 model and genuinely have no owning project;
-- they get NO ROW HERE, and a reader asking whose production such a case was is
-- answered "undetermined" by the missing row rather than by a NULL that would
-- read as a project the record lost. Backfilling a project would be inventing an
-- attribution to get past a gate, which this record refuses everywhere else.
-- The constraint is affordable here precisely BECAUSE the table is new: the two
-- columns this item adds to published_case_members are nullable for the mirror
-- reason -- their rows already exist and honestly lack the fact.
--
-- WHO WRITES IT: CASE-2, which is where publishCase() first takes a publishing
-- project and an owner-only fence. CASE-1 built the object and wrote no row,
-- so until CASE-2 the export answered project_id NULL for every case in the store
-- and said so. That was a stated state of the record, not a gap in the answer.
--
-- THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO opened_by. The act's author belongs to the ACT, and
-- the act that mints this identity is the publication of an edition, which
-- published_cases already carries. A second author column here would be a second
-- authority for one fact, which is how the drift this repo keeps finding starts.
--
-- AND THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO INDEX ON project_id YET. "Which cases does this
-- project own" is clause 6's query and it is CASE-2's and CASE-6's to ask -- an
-- index declared before any statement filters on it is REC-69's own class, an
-- access path built for a question no op asks. It belongs in the commit that
-- brings its reader.

-- CASE-5b / DEC-72: THE CASE DOCUMENT -- THE THING A MEMBER SIGNS WHEN WHAT IS
-- BEING ASSERTED IS THE CASE'S OWN, AND NOT ANY ONE FINDING'S.
--
-- WHY IT EXISTS, and the reason is a wall CASE-5 measured rather than a feature
-- anyone wanted. Every case fact this plane commits is committed FROM THE SIGNED
-- BYTES AND FROM NOTHING ELSE (#publishEdges' doctrine). Until this table the
-- only signed bytes in the system were a FINDING's, so op=publish stamped the
-- case's scope, roster, partition, bias acknowledgement and bar into EVERY
-- member's frontmatter -- N copies of one fact, each inside a different
-- signature, held together by four divergence refusals. A finding's bytes could
-- not stop naming a case, because there was no signature over a case for those
-- facts to move to.
--
-- THE CONSTRAINT THAT SHAPED IT is the container manifest's own sentence: a
-- case-level signature would be a signature over SOMETHING NOBODY REVIEWED. So
-- what is stored here is not a synthesised summary of the roster. It is the
-- publisher's own authored assertions, written once, in the words they authored
-- them in at the ceremony -- the scope, the completeness statement, the
-- exclusions and their reasons, the subject position and its justification, the
-- bias acknowledgement, the load-bearing partition, the bar -- assembled into a
-- document a member reads whole and signs. Every sentence in it was typed by a
-- person at op=publish. The roster appears because a partition needs targets,
-- and it appears WITH THE PINS, which is clause 3's freeze stated where the
-- freeze is actually asserted.
--
-- doc_sha IS THE IDENTITY THE SIGNATURE COVERS, and text is kept beside it so
-- the document can be re-read and re-verified without this instance being
-- trusted to re-render it. Rendering it twice is exactly the equality that costs

-- ONE ROW PER (case edition, MEMBER, exclusion row): an excluded document is reported on each member
-- finding of the case, as inquiry_exclusions always reported it, and the member, its own edition
-- and the publishing project are columns so op=excludedby answers in ONE indexed, gated statement
