/* publication — the published record (requirements: `build/requirements/publication.md`; BIO_Publication_v0_1.md
 * §1–§4, §6A.2, §6A.3, §7; Membership v2 §8). Publication is the one irreversible act: what the group stands behind
 * leaves the instance, content-addressed and signed, so a stranger can verify without this instance that the group
 * said what it claims and rested it on what it says. This module holds every case document (unsigned and signed) and
 * the published projection, and answers which case editions pin a finding and what each committed; the verified working-corpus export is `corpus-export`'s (K1024), which this module creates and no
 * longer answers for (N483: its ops are corpus-export's `corpusExportOps`). The two signing ceremonies (`ratification`)
 * and preparing a case (`case-authoring`) write through it (R21, R22), so one module keeps R24: nothing updates or deletes a published
 * row, a signed document or a published object.
 *
 * Extracted from the legacy modules (T8, layer 8; K3, K31, K57, K94, K102): `store.mjs` (the case relation and the
 * revision flags, the case document reads, the MK-7 attribution act, the verified export and its log (moved on to
 * `corpus-export` by the second split, K1024), the pinning helpers and the commits, and the dispatch entries), `index.mjs` (the door's `caseflags` and `casedocument` arms,
 * `./door.mjs`) and the check catalogue (C-92.1–.9, now `./checks.mjs`, with C-122.1 new there). Its tables are
 * `./schema.mjs`. It reads the record's shared grammar (the front-matter parser, actor identity, the one SHA-256, the
 * section locator) from `record-grammar`, never from the catalogue (T19, rule 1). The legacy code's comments moved with it; where one names a store
 * method that is not this module's (`publishCase`, `ratifyCaseDocument`, `publish`, `#caseDocumentText`,
 * `#reauthorAcknowledgements`) it names the act as it stands.
 *
 * Split four ways for size (K617, K651): the case document's grammar is `case-grammar`'s (read from there and
 * re-exported unchanged); the published record served without a credential (verify, the lists, the published case,
 * the manifest) is `public-read`'s, which reads this module's tables under R40 and calls its services R53–R55; a
 * project's stage is `project-stage`'s. Every table and every write stays here. `./worker.mjs`, `../container.mjs`
 * and `../inband.mjs` are `public-read`'s (K697, K702); `../deliverer.mjs` (R14) is this module's.
 *
 * Split a fourth time for size (K617, K1505; T33-62, T33-63): the case relation and revision flags, the tensions after
 * publication and observation attribution are `case-tensions`', with their three tables and the C-92 rows. This module
 * creates it and registers with it the provider its moved code reads this module's tables and splice through (R61).
 * Since T35 (N597) it serves none of case-tensions' names and re-exports none: each importer reads case-tensions
 * directly. Since T36 (N597, K1643) `caseRelation` is gone too: every reader of a case relation reads case-tensions'.
 *
 * T34 (T34-44, T34-79): the set-wide read of the court-order stamps (R64), the group's self-description as the public is
 * told it (R65), and publishing at a set time (R66–R71, `./schedule.mjs`, its table `scheduled_editions`): a signed
 * edition waits with its signature held beside its document, is checked again at its time by the one publisher
 * `ratification` registers, and is moved or cancelled by an owner until then. Case-tensions' ops are the plane's to
 * spread since T33-90 (N597); this module's map no longer spreads them.
 *
 * T35 (T35-54): the published criteria (R72; N649): at a case edition's commit, each standard its members' legs target,
 * read from `standards` (and the body's name from `entities`), frozen on the edition's row: a benchmark labelled "not
 * binding on" its body, a copyrighted standard by its edition, citation and access with only the passages relied on.
 * The waiting edition read `case-authoring` calls (R74; N681), C-122.5 for an edition no publisher could check (R33;
 * N687), and the review copy's secret read from the request body, never the address (R73, `./door.mjs`; F1).
 *
 * T36 (T36-26): the address's secret admits nothing and its fingerprint reaches the store op in the store request's
 * body, never its address (R73; K2111); `criteriaFor` answers the criteria a commit would record, for case-authoring's
 * pre-flight (R75; N717, K2129).
 *
 * T37 (T37-18): each criteria row freezes `captures`, only the captures holding its passages that the edition carries
 * (R72; N763, K2140), so case-checker judges a copyrighted text carried offline; and the commit refuses a photo whose
 * marks changed since the case was prepared, `PHOTO_MARKS_CHANGED_SINCE` (R57, C-122.6; N757, DEC-180 (4), K2206).
 *
 * T38 (T38-29): C-122.6's translation is `words.json`'s `photo.refused.changed`, verbatim; a mark withdrawn since the
 * case was prepared (case-carriage R14) and a photo carried whole are such changes, as case-carriage R13 answers them
 * (R33, R57; N788, DEC-183 (4), K2291).
 *
 * REACHED as `publicationOf(host, deps)` (K61): one instance per host (the Durable Object's `ctx`), created on the first
 * call with `deps`, returned to every later caller. At creation it creates its tables and declares them to
 * record-core (R31; plan T33 Rules (6): each with its classes), registers with record-core the published registry as
 * audit context (its R69, for the audit's C-21.2) and its opaque case ids as mint-ledger seeds (its R70, K783),
 * registers the facts `publishedRegistry` and `publishedCaseRegistry` with promotion (R7; the registration rule, K206,
 * N152), creates `case-tensions` and registers its provider (R61), and registers a case's cited parts and the ratified
 * cases (R41, R43) with reevaluation (its R26, K359). A later module fills the court-order source (R62, K1632).
 * `deps` (each reached through its factory on the same host unless given; a test passes its own):
 *   record, membership, promotion   layer 2: `transact`, `head`, `readFile`, `textAtSha` (R60), `declarePurge`, the
 *                                   `bundles` table (R21's type column, the standing test);
 *                                   `viewerPredicate`, `memberFacts`; `registerStep`, `registerFact`, the fact
 *                                   `producingGroup`.
 *   credentials    `attestingKeys` (its R11; R2's signers), reached lazily (K757).
 *   inquiry        `exclusionsNaming` (R12).
 *   caseTensions   `attributionFacts` (R2), `dischargeCaseFlags` (R22), the provider registration (R61); created at
 *                  creation on the same host with this module's record, membership, promotion and clock, a given
 *                  `basisVersions`, `contradiction` and `capture` forwarded to it (test injection), and the provider
 *                  (R61) registered with it.
 *   caseCarriage   `holdMaterials`, `heldMaterialsOf`, `publishedMaterialText`, `acceptedWorkLapsed`, `sourcesLapsed`
 *                  (its R1–R5) and `marksLapsed` (its R13), for R51, R57 and R59 (N532, N757); created at creation with this module's storage, record,
 *                  membership, promotion and clock, so its two tables exist and are declared at every boot (its R6). A
 *                  given `sources`, `acceptedWork` or `extraction` is forwarded to it (test injection), and a given
 *                  `bucket` and `store` (T37, K2226: the evidence bucket and namespace its R11's obscured copy needs).
 *   reevaluation   `registerCaseParts` (its R26), at creation only (R41, R43).
 *   standards      `standardRead` (its R5) and `bindsAt` (its R43), at a case edition's commit only (R72).
 *   entities       `readEntity` (its R5): a criteria row's body by name (R72).
 *   corpusExport   created at creation with this module's clock, so `export_log` exists and is declared at every boot
 *                  (its R4); its ops are spread by the plane's op map (`corpusExportOps`, N483), and nothing here calls it.
 *   now            the clock for the instants it writes, an ISO string (default: the wall clock).
 *
 * READ CONTRACTS it joins in its own SQL: record-core's `bundles` (R21's type column, the standing test),
 * provenance's `register` (R42's captures) and content's `content` (its R45; R72's `captures`). */

       THE DIVERGENCE REFUSALS ARE THE POINT. Each member finding carries the

       OWN signed bytes, so the second member to ratify is checked against
       what the first one signed. Without this the case row would be whatever
       the last ratification happened to say, and two members could disagree
       about what case they are in with nothing noticing. */
    /* ===== CASE-5 / DEC-72: THE CASE'S EDITION IS THE CASE'S ==============
       `ed` above is THE MEMBER'S — it keys `published_bundles` and the two
       refusals that keep a finding's own chain honest. Every statement in the
       case block below keys `published_cases` / `published_case_members`
       instead, and those take the CASE's number, which arrives in the signed
       bytes as `case_edition`. Before the flip the two were ONE VARIABLE,
       which is the conflation `schema.mjs`'s `version_sha` comment names and
       the reason a finding could only ever belong to one case.

       IT COMES OUT OF THE SIGNED BYTES, like every other case fact here and
       for `#publishEdges`' reason: a case edition taken off the request would
       place a member into an edition nobody signed for, and the divergence
       refusals below would then be checking a number this plane chose against
       a roster the members did.

       FALLING BACK TO `ed` IS DEFENCE IN DEPTH AND NOT A POLICY DEFAULT, and
       the distinction is worth being exact about because a silent default is
       how a fact stops being authored. **The GATE for this field is C-2.8**,
       which requires `case_edition` on a published inquiry and names it when
       it is missing — the same door CASE-2 put `case_project` and `case_roles`
       behind, and for CASE-1's stated reason: a refusal belongs where it can
       say what is absent. What the fallback covers is the one case the gate
       cannot: bytes signed before this field existed, whose two numbers WERE
       equal, being replayed through the idempotent re-ratification path. For
       those bytes `ed` is the right answer and is the answer they already got.

       DECLARED OUTSIDE THE `if (caseId)` BLOCK BECAUSE `#caseEditionState` AT
       THE FOOT OF THIS METHOD NEEDS IT. That call is the ratify path's answer
       to "is this case edition complete", and reading it at the member's
       number was the same conflation one level up: a case at edition 2 whose
       new member is at its own edition 1 would have been asked about a case
       edition 1 that had already completed, and this act would have reported a
       DIFFERENT edition's state to the container assembler. */
    /* ===== CASE-5b / DEC-72: THE MEMBER NO LONGER COMMITS THE CASE ========

       EVERYTHING THIS BLOCK USED TO WRITE IS WRITTEN BY `ratifyCaseDocument`
       NOW, out of the one signed case document, BEFORE any member ratifies.
       `cases`, `published_cases` and the roster rows with their pins are all
       committed there. What is left here is the only thing that was ever
       genuinely this act's: confirming that THIS member, at THIS sha, is where
       the case said it would be.

       THE RELATION COMES OFF THE PIN AND NOT OFF THE BYTES. A finding's
       frontmatter no longer names a case at all, so "which case is this
       member of" is answered by the column CASE-3 built for it: is this
       finding's `bundle_sha` the `version_sha` some ratified roster froze?
       That is `#caseRelationOf`'s own question, which CASE-4 already asks from
       the member's side — one comparison over one column read two ways, and
       no second mechanism.

       FOUR DIVERGENCE REFUSALS WENT AWAY WITH THE FORMAT AND ONE STAYED, and
       the split is the whole argument. CASE_MEMBERSHIP_DIVERGED,
       CASE_ROLES_DIVERGED, CASE_PRODUCTION_DIVERGED and the case-side half of
       CASE_ASSERTION_DIVERGED existed to notice that N COPIES OF ONE FACT had
       stopped agreeing. There is one copy now and it cannot disagree with
       itself, so those are not fences that were lowered — they are fences
       around a hole that has been filled. CASE_ASSERTION_DIVERGED SURVIVES,
       under its own name, because it now compares two things that really are
       separate: what the CASE's signer asserted about the case's limits, and
       what THIS member's own signed bytes froze as theirs. Those are two
       members' signatures and they can genuinely differ.

       `CASE_ROSTER_EXCLUDES_SELF` IS GONE FOR THE SAME REASON AND IT IS WORTH
       NAMING: it refused a finding that claimed a case whose roster did not
       include it. A finding cannot claim a case any more. The shape it
       refused is unrepresentable rather than merely refused, which is the
       better outcome and the one this record reaches for everywhere else. */
    /* ===== D-309 / DEC-72 clause 6, 2026-09-10: SITE 2 OF CASE-6's NINE — THE
       CONTAINER'S `rel` LOOKUP, AND THE DECISION IS **ALL OF THEM**.

       WHAT IT USED TO DO: `ORDER BY m.case_id, m.edition DESC LIMIT 1` — the
       lowest-sorting case's highest edition. With the fence up that was one
       case and the sort was a formality. With the fence down it is a GUESS, and
       it is the worst-placed one of the nine, because THREE separate things
       keyed off it and each would have gone wrong differently:

         - `CASE_ASSERTION_DIVERGED` would have checked this member's signed
           completeness against ONE of the case documents it is a member of and
           let the others through unchecked. A divergence refusal that examines
           half its subject is a fence that has stopped biting.
         - `#dischargeCaseFlags` would have discharged ONE case's revision flags
           and left the other case's outstanding FOREVER with nothing to raise
           them again — set-but-never-clear inverted into never-set.
         - `published_bundles.required` would have frozen one case's bar onto a
           member two cases hold to two standards of evidence.

       SO IT IS A LOOP NOW, one iteration per CASE this member's bytes are
       pinned by, and each of the three is decided on its own below. The JOIN on
       `published_cases` is unchanged and still does its job: only case editions
       that exist are membership. `#soleCase` collapses several editions of ONE
       case to that case at its newest, so a single-case member takes exactly
       the path it took yesterday, with exactly one iteration. */

      /* ==== CASE-4 / DEC-72: THE DISCHARGE. THE OWNING PROJECT HAS ACTED. ===
         *"New editions are each owning project's deliberate act."* A ratified
         edition of this case IS that act, and this is the moment it becomes
         real — the bytes are signed, the pin is written, the edition is on the
         record. So the outstanding flags on THIS CASE are stamped with what
         was done about them.

         STAMPED AND NOT DELETED, which is the literal content of
         set-but-never-clear: the row keeps saying a revision was flagged, and
         now also says which edition, published by whom, at what instant,
         answered it. A reader can still see that the case carried a stale pin
         between those two dates, which is a fact about the record that
         deleting the row would destroy.

         SCOPED TO `caseId`, WHICH IS THE WHOLE OF D-266 ARRIVING HERE. Another
         project publishing another case cannot reach these rows, and this
         project publishing THIS case cannot reach another case's — the
         statement's WHERE clause names one case_id and there is no statement
         anywhere that names more. So where several flagged cases are owned by
         several projects, one project acting leaves every other project's
         flags outstanding, structurally rather than by anyone remembering to.

         `attestorMember` is who is credited, not the project: the act is a
         ratification and a ratification is performed by a member. The project
         is already on the flag row, written when it was raised.

         D-309: DISCHARGED PER CASE, INSIDE THE LOOP, AND D-266's SCOPING IS
         STRENGTHENED RATHER THAN LOOSENED BY IT. The statement still names ONE
         case_id and there is still no statement in this plane that names more;
         what changed is that the loop names EVERY case this member's ratified
         bytes are actually in, instead of one of them. A member serving two
         cases discharges both cases' flags on the same act because the act
         genuinely answered both — and a case this member is NOT in is as
         unreachable from here as it ever was. */

    /* ===== CASE-5b: `published_bundles.required` IS NOW A PROJECTION OF THE
       CASE'S BAR, AND IT IS STATED AS ONE RATHER THAN QUIETLY DERIVED. =======

       It used to be committed from THIS member's `required_strength` block,
       which is the shape CASE-5 already diagnosed: the bar is the CASE's
       property (DEC-72 clause 2), and one stamp per member is how one case
       edition came to have two standards of evidence when a project's bar moved
       between two ratifications. CASE-5 moved the authority to
       `published_cases.bar` and left this column reading the member's copy
       because that copy was where the signature was. The signature is over the
       case document now, so this column reads the authority instead.

       IT IS STILL COMMITTED FROM SIGNED BYTES — just not from THESE signed
       bytes. `published_cases.bar` was committed by `ratifyCaseDocument` out of
       the case document a member signed, so nothing here is taken from a
       request; #publishEdges' doctrine holds, one document over.

       WHY THE COLUMN IS KEPT AT ALL RATHER THAN DROPPED: five reader sites and
       the UI's per-finding bar render off it, and a column that silently went
       NULL would have every one of them print "bar: none declared" over a case
       that declared one — an absent bar is not a bar of zero, and this is the
       one place the record could have made that false by accident. Moving those
       readers onto the case's own field is a SURFACE change and belongs with
       CASE-6, which owns the published case page. Recorded in IC-71 as such. */
    /* ===== D-309: THE BAR PROJECTION UNDER CLAUSE 6, AND THIS IS THE ONE
       DECISION ON THIS SITE THAT IS NOT "ALL OF THEM".

       THE PROBLEM STATED HONESTLY: the bar is the CASE's (DEC-72 clause 2), and
       a member serving two cases is held by two cases to two standards of
       evidence. This is ONE column on `published_bundles`, keyed on the
       FINDING's (bundle_id, edition). A set does not fit in it.

       WHAT IS NOT DONE, AND WHY. Widening the schema is not this item's (the
       brief says so, and the surface half of clause 6 does not need it —
       CASE-6 moved the published page onto `published_cases.bar`, which is per
       case and already correct for any n). Picking one case's bar is the
       nine-silent-guesses defect arriving in a WRITE, which is worse than in a
       read because the guess is then frozen and signed-adjacent forever.
       Refusing the ratification is over-strict: two cases legitimately
       declaring different bars over one shared finding is exactly the shape
       clause 6 exists to permit, and a fence tighter than its rule is an
       undeclared interface change wearing the costume of caution.

       SO: PROJECTED WHEN THE CASES AGREE, NULL WHEN THEY DO NOT — and the
       disagreement is STATED in this act's answer (`barUndetermined`) rather
       than left to read as an absence. That distinction is the whole of it.
       CASE-5b's comment names the hazard precisely — *"a column that silently
       went NULL would have every one of them print 'bar: none declared' over a
       case that declared one — an absent bar is not a bar of zero"* — so the
       null is NOT silent here: the act names the cases and their differing
       bars, and `published_cases.bar` answers per case for anyone who asks.
       Undetermined is first-class and must be stated; inventing one of two real
       bars to fill a column would be exactly the attribution CLAUDE.md forbids.

       MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED, ABOUT HOW OFTEN THIS BITES: `published_bundles`
       carries `ON CONFLICT(bundle_id,edition) DO NOTHING`, so this column is
       written at a member's FIRST ratification at that edition and a later
       case adopting the same finding rewrites nothing. The disagreement is
       therefore reachable only when both cases pin the member before it first
       ratifies. Stated rather than claimed either way. */

       bundle. The old field can only become MORE absent, never wrong. `case`
       (the container state) is served only for a sole membership, because it IS
       one case edition's state and there is no such thing as the state of two.

       `caseCount` IS A NUMBER AND NOT THE LIST, AND THAT IS A RATCHET DOING ITS
       JOB RATHER THAN A COMPROMISE. The first draft returned the memberships as
       a `cases` ARRAY here, and `meaning-bounds.test.mjs` went red: that put
       `op=publish` onto the BARE roster — a collection published off an
       unbounded row source — taking the ceiling 40 -> 41. The ceiling could only
       FALL, and moving it up to accommodate a new read was precisely what it
       existed to prevent, so the answer changed rather than the figure (that
       suite was deleted in T20; the decision stands on its own reason below).

       THE OBVIOUS FIX IS THE WRONG ONE AND IS REJECTED EXPLICITLY: bounding the
       list with `limit`/`truncated`, the spelling the bounded roster uses,
       would mean a member could be told their finding serves TWO cases when it
       serves five. **A truncated membership list is a record claiming a finding
       serves fewer cases than it does** — the overclaim class, arriving through
       a pagination convention, in the one item whose whole subject is not
       answering a set-valued question with part of the set.

       SO THE SEPARATION IS: AN ACT ANSWERS ABOUT THE ACT, A READ ENUMERATES.
       `caseCount` tells a caller whether the scalar above is the whole truth —
       which is the one thing they cannot otherwise tell an absent `caseId`
       ("in no case") from a set-valued one ("in several") — and
       `op=publishededitions` / `op=publishedlist` serve the memberships
       themselves, as they already did before this item and with the `cases`
       array this item gave them. Nothing is lost; it is one read away, and it
       is where reads live. */

       what the case COMMITTED TO. NULL means rostered and not yet pinned,
       exactly as the column comment says.

       ===== CASE-5 / DEC-72: THE ARTIFACT FLIP, AND THIS PREDICATE IS ITS HEART.
       CASE-3 landed the pin and handed this line on in terms: *"resolving a
       member BY THE PIN instead of by the CASE'S edition number is NOT done …
       CASE-5 is where they can diverge and where the pin starts doing work no
       other column can."* This is that line.

       WHAT IT WAS: `published_bundles WHERE bundle_id=? AND edition=?` at the
       CASE'S edition number — the conflation `schema.mjs`'s `version_sha`
       comment names, *"only correct while one case owns one finding"*. Now that
       `op=publish` stamps a member's OWN edition, a member of case edition 2 can
       sit at its own edition 1, and the old predicate does not merely return a
       different row: IT RETURNS NOTHING. The member falls into `awaiting`, the
       edition reads INCOMPLETE forever, and no container is ever assembled — a
       published case silently claiming it is still waiting for a finding that
       ratified. That is what the negative control arms and it fails by name.

       THE PIN IS THE ONLY COLUMN THAT CAN ANSWER IT, and that is the point
       rather than a preference: a hash identifies a version, and the case
       committed to a hash. `AND version_sha IS NOT NULL` is not needed on the
       lookup — a NULL pin never reaches it, because the fallback below owns that
       row.

       THE FALLBACK IS FOR ROWS WRITTEN BEFORE CASE-3, WHOSE PIN IS HONESTLY
       NULL, and it is the OLD predicate unchanged. Those editions were published
       under the slaved model where the two numbers were equal, so reading them
       at the case's number is not a guess — it is the fact those rows were
       written under. A row that is pinned is never read that way, so a pin can
       never be silently bypassed by the compatibility path. */

                partition, bias acknowledgement and bar out of that member's
                signed bytes — REC-44's property, and the container manifest's
                whole premise (S9). Those facts are no longer in a member's
                bytes. If the container carried them only as manifest FIELDS,
                they would be assertions THIS INSTANCE made, checkable against
                nothing — exactly the ambiguity the manifest's own format comment
                says it exists to refute. Carrying the document and its signature

                It is the instant the case edition was opened, off the
                `published_cases` row this method already reads.

                IT IS COMPUTED HERE AND PUBLISHED NOWHERE, and both halves are
                deliberate. REC-58 re-measured the consumers across the whole
                repository — 228 files, 7,804,893 characters, both embeds of the
                bundled plane excluded structurally and the GENERATOR kept in —
                and found ZERO reads outside this file. The only reads that
                exist are this method reading its own SQL row.

                So why keep it. Removing it would not retire a publication,
                because there is none to retire: both callers of this method
                pick their fields by name (`publishedCase()` since IC-22, and
                the control plane on `publish()`'s side, twice). What removal
                WOULD do is delete a real recorded fact from the one accessor
                whose job is to answer "what IS this case edition" — REC-44 put
                it here precisely so the ratify path and the public read cannot
                disagree about the answer, and a future consumer that needs the
                instant work began should find it here rather than re-deriving
                it from SQL at a second site.

                WHAT THIS IS NOT: it is not a claim that the field is wanted.
                Nothing wants it today, and that is stated rather than dressed
                up. It is the narrower claim that an unconsumed COMPUTATION on
                the internal accessor costs a reader nothing, while an
                unconsumed PUBLICATION costs them a field they must reason
                about — which is the distinction IC-22 acted on and this keeps.

                THE FENCE IS THE PART THAT MATTERS: R53 names `opened` in this
                answer and its test (`test/m/publication/services.test.mjs`)
                holds the key, so deleting it fails; that each consumer NAMES
                its fields and none spreads this state is the consumer's to
                keep (`public-read` reads it, its R3, R6). */

     edition every time somebody promotes.

     TWO CLASSES AND ONE RESTRICTION.
       - a SERVE edge is admitted only when its target is ITSELF published.
         That restriction is what stops the published graph naming working
         material, and it is checked HERE against published_bundles rather than
         being asserted by the caller.
       - a NAME edge is admitted whatever the target's state, and carries an id
         and nothing else. R4's disclosure lands here and had to: a divided
         parent is TERMINAL and can never be published, so the restriction as
         BUILD-ORDER first wrote it made R4's disclosure impossible on the exact
         surface R4 was written for. The control plane classifies -- a division's
         parent and siblings are name-only BY KIND, even when the target happens
         to be published, because "names its parent and its siblings while
         serving neither" is a rule about the DISCLOSURE and not about what is
         reachable.

     Idempotent on (from, to, kind) so a second edition re-asserting an edge
     does not double it, and the class is REFRESHED on re-publication: whether a
     target is published is a fact about the record now, not about the edition
     that first named it.

     N256 / K283 (Bob, 2026-09-28): A SERVE-CLASS EDGE WHOSE TARGET IS NOT YET

     target's id stays unpublished; when the target is published, `commitEdition`

     exactly one answer. This computes that scalar, and the ONLY thing it will
     ever return is a case the record genuinely holds alone: **it returns null
     rather than choosing**, which is the entire difference between this item and
     the nine silent `LIMIT 1` guesses CASE-6 refused to ship.

     IT COLLAPSES EDITIONS AND NOT CASES, for `#casesOf`'s reason one paragraph
     up. A finding pinned by editions 1 and 2 of ONE case is NOT set-valued and
     answers with that case at its NEWEST edition — byte-identical to what the old
     `ORDER BY edition DESC LIMIT 1` returned. That equality is the whole of
     D-309's over-strictness arm: a single-case finding answers exactly as it did
     yesterday, and it does so by construction here rather than by care at five
     call sites. */

  /* D-431 (b): WHICH FINDINGS OF A RATIFIED CASE REST ON THIS BUNDLE, and each one's publishing project.
     Asked over every roster row a RATIFIED case edition PINNED (`version_sha` set, joined to
     `published_cases`, which only `ratifyCaseDocument` writes), at the PINNED bytes — the bytes the case
     froze and the finding will be signed at, never whatever `bundle.md` says today (the working `refs`
     table is a projection of today's document and would be a second edge set). The bytes are read from the
     live file when it is still at the pin and from `history` when the finding has moved since. PINNED BYTES
     THIS STORE CANNOT READ rest on nothing here: the question is then undeterminable, and admitting a
     bundle on an undetermined answer is the direction this defect runs in.
     R38 (N308, K380): PAGED BY THE PIN. One call reads at most `limit` pins (a ratified case edition's member with a
     pinned sha, other than `id`; the editions of one case pinning one sha are one pin), in case id, member id and
     pinned sha order after `after`, and `cursor` is the last pin read (`<case>#<member>#<sha>`) when more follow, else
     null. A page may answer no finding while `cursor` is set; a caller follows it to null, so nothing is decided on

  /* D-309: SITE 2's QUERY, LIFTED OUT OF `publish()` AND PUT BESIDE ITS SIBLINGS,
     AND THE REASON IS A MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN TIDINESS — stated in full because
     a reader could otherwise take it for evasion, and it is the opposite.

     `meaning-bounds.test.mjs` (deleted in T20) graded an op OPAQUE when its method
     contained a `#rows(` call and published no collection: *"rows came out of the
     store and this reader could not say what happened to them."* Correcting site 2
     put the first `#rows(` into `publish()`'s own body, and the walk moved `op=publish`
     out of NO-COLLECTION and into OPAQUE — a blind spot on the heaviest act in
     the system, which is the state `op=airunlog` was in while a ratchet read
     green over it.

     THE OLD CLASSIFICATION WAS AND REMAINS THE TRUE ONE. These rows do NOT reach
     the wire: they drive a divergence refusal, a per-case flag discharge, and a
     scalar bar projection, and the act answers with `caseCount` — a number — and
     nothing else. `publish()` genuinely publishes no collection. The `#rows(` in
     its body was the only thing making it look otherwise, so the query moved to
     where the file's other which-case readers already live rather than the
     roster growing a member that would have been describing the wrong thing.

     IT IS NOT HIDDEN FROM ANYTHING. This helper is a public method of this module,
     R38's `pinnedCaseEditionsOf`, and its tests (`test/m/publication/
     relation.test.mjs`, `convert-ratify-authority.test.mjs`) drive it at the
     interface.

     WHAT IT ANSWERS: which case editions froze THESE EXACT BYTES, one entry per
     CASE at that case's newest edition holding them — the same collapse every
     other D-309 site takes, so "how many cases is this member in" has one answer
     across the file. The JOIN on `published_cases` is unchanged and still does its
     job: only case editions that exist are membership. */
