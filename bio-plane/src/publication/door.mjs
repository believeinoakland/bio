/* publication — the door's half of `op=caseflags` and `op=casedocument` (requirements: `build/requirements/publication.md`
 * R1, R29; `op=caseflags` answers `case-tensions` R3, was this module's R6, through the store op this module spreads
 * until the plane's op map spreads case-tensions' own). Moved from `src/index.mjs` (the legacy-index map's §4.4 move, K649 (7); §12.2), with their comments: the
 * two arms answer through this module's own store ops (`publicationOps`' `caseflags` and `casedocument`), pinned to `bio`
 * as before. The door keeps what is the door's and hands it in (control-plane, later in the order): its envelope
 * helpers (`json`, `storeSilent`, `storeRefusal`, `doAnswer`), the reader's stamp and its resolution (`readerOf`, the
 * door's `caseReader` over the presented credential, asked only for `casedocument`), the secret's hash (`sha256Hex`) and
 * the statement a member signs (`NS_RATIFY`, `caseRatifyStatement`, signatures'), so this module imports none of them.
 *
 * `publicationDoorOp(op, url, stub, helpers)` answers one of the two ops, or null for any other, so the door asks it and
 * goes on. The request's body reaches it through the helpers as `body`: the parsed JSON object, or a function answering
 * it (or a Promise of it), the control plane's to pass (R73; F1, K1874). */
