/* Deploy ONE fleet member to ONE instance, with every binding target TEMPLATED
 * from that instance's slug.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NOT `bio-plane/scripts/deploy.mjs`.
 * That script deploys the PLANE. It sends a hardcoded binding list and a
 * `keep_bindings` tuned to the plane's own shape, and it refuses `civicos` and
 * `pdf-worker` BY NAME (D-201) because pointing it at another worker deletes
 * bindings that worker needs. `kickoffs/DIST-NEXT.md` tells the next session "if
 * you deploy a fleet member, do not reach for deploy.mjs" — and until now that
 * sentence named no alternative, which is a rule without a mechanism. This is
 * the mechanism.
 *
 * THE DEFECT IT EXISTS TO FIX, measured 2026-08-10 and re-measured 2026-09-10:
 * `agent-worker/wrangler.jsonc` declares `service PLANE -> "bio-plane"`, and
 * NO WORKER IS EVER DEPLOYED UNDER THE NAME `bio-plane`. The plane's worker name
 * is the INSTANCE name (D-102): the smoke instance is `biosmoke7` and a group's
 * instance is named by the group. So Cloudflare refuses the deploy outright —
 *
 *     Service binding 'PLANE' references Worker 'bio-plane' which was not found
 *     [code: 10143]
 *
 * — which is D-292. The fix is NOT to write `biosmoke7` into the tracked config:
 * that hardcodes the smoke instance into a file meant to be installed into
 * arbitrary group accounts, which is the same defect inverted. The fix is to
 * SUBSTITUTE the instance slug at deploy time, which is what this does.
 *
 * WHY IT SHELLS OUT TO WRANGLER INSTEAD OF PUTTING BYTES LIKE deploy.mjs DOES,
 * and this is a constraint rather than a preference. `agent-worker/wrangler.jsonc`
 * records a deliberate FLEET decision at its `main` key: THE SOURCE DEPLOYS, NOT
 * A BUNDLE, because a committed bundle is "a second place its version lives and a
 * committed artifact that can drift from its source (D-106's class)". The member
 * is three modules (`index.mjs` imports `./harness.mjs` and `./subsession.mjs`),
 * so a raw REST upload of one part cannot resolve them — a REST deployer would
 * therefore FORCE a build step and silently reverse FLEET's decision. Wrangler
 * bundles from source at deploy, so routing through it keeps that decision
 * intact. The generated config below is a TEMP FILE, deleted in a finally, and
 * the tracked config is never written to.
 *
 * (The INSTALLER cannot do any of this — it is a Worker and cannot run wrangler,
 * so DS-1's installer half needs a bundled, hashed, signed asset per member in
 * the release. That is a release-format change and is where FLEET's no-build-step
 * decision has to be revisited deliberately, with FLEET told. It is NOT decided
 * here; see D-297.)
 *
 * A CONTAINER MEMBER (bundler R26; N624, K1705) deploys the same way, with one step
 * before it: its image, named by digest in its own marker, is pulled and pushed to
 * Cloudflare's registry with the account's token (the project's own copy; a group's
 * copy pulls from the public registry by digest at install, M-Q8), and the generated
 * config's `containers[].image` names that pushed copy. A member with several classes
 * (T36-2) pushes each class's image and points each `containers[]` entry at its own
 * class's copy, by `class_name`. A token that cannot reach
 * Containers is refused by name before anything is pulled, pushed or deployed —
 * 0.80.0 shipped without its container for exactly that (K1705 (3)).
 *
 * usage (bundler R19, R20, R26; moved from the old process's `tools/` in T19), from the repository root:
 *   node bio-plane/scripts/deploy-fleet.mjs <member> --instance <slug>
 *   node bio-plane/scripts/deploy-fleet.mjs agent-worker --instance biosmoke7 --dry-run
