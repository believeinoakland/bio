/* ONE version across the plane and every fleet member, and a refusal that names
 * the exact edit. DS-2 / D-116.
 *
 * ---- WHY THE FLEET NEEDS ONE VERSION AT ALL --------------------------------
 *
 * A release is now a SET of artifacts — the plane plus each member — carried by
 * one `RELEASE.json` under one `version`, and covered by one signature over a
 * statement that names all of them (D-297, `fleetStatement`). If members carried
 * their own version numbers, that single `version` field would be a claim about
 * nothing: a release stamped 0.57.0 could contain a member built as 0.1.0, and
 * the only honest thing to write in the manifest would be "several". So the
 * fleet shares the plane's version, and `bio-plane/package.json` is THE declared
 * authority — one source of truth, no second number to age separately, which is
 * D-106's rule applied across a directory boundary instead of within one.
 *
 * ---- WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG, MEASURED 2026-09-11 --------------------------
 *
 *   bio-plane    package.json 0.56.0   wrangler VERSION 0.56.0
 *   pdf-worker   package.json 0.1.0    wrangler VERSION 0.1.0
 *   agent-worker package.json 0.1.0    wrangler VERSION 0.1.0
 *
 * Five of six sites disagreed with the authority and NOTHING refused, because
 * nothing had ever compared them: `deploy.mjs` takes the version as a positional
 * ARGUMENT, so the operator's typing has been the only thing deciding what a
 * deploy claims to be. `resolveVersion` did not exist — DS-2's own row names it
 * as though it did, which is the "a note is not an item" class this lane has now
 * hit three times (D-292, D-297, here).
 *
 * ---- BOTH DIRECTIONS, AND WHY THAT IS NOT PEDANTRY -------------------------
 *
 * The refusal fires when a member is BEHIND the authority and when it is AHEAD.
 * Behind is the ordinary staleness. Ahead is the dangerous one: it means someone
 * bumped a member alone, and a release cut then would ship an artifact claiming a
 * version the plane has never been built as — a number that will later be cut
 * properly and mean something else. A version is a promise about bytes
 * (release-assemble.mjs's VERSION_ALREADY_RELEASED), and two different byte sets
 * must never wear one.
