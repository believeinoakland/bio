/* Deploy a signed release to a Worker, and believe only the bytes.
 *
 * The lesson this encodes was learned the hard way on 2026-07-28: a deploy
 * returned an HTML error page instead of JSON, the script threw while parsing
 * it, and the instance was still running the previous version. A retry
 * succeeded. The tempting conclusion was "do not retry after an unexpected
 * response". That is the wrong lesson.
 *
 * The right one is that the API's answer is not evidence either way. A success
 * response can precede a rollout that has not happened yet; an HTML error page
 * can be a gateway hiccup in front of an upload that landed. So this never
 * reports success from what the API said. It reads the script BACK from the
 * account, hashes it, and compares against the signed asset. That comparison is
 * the only thing here that decides anything, and it is equally capable of
 * catching a silent failure and a silent success.
 *
 * Retrying is therefore safe rather than reckless: a PUT of a whole script is
 * idempotent, and the verification runs regardless of how many attempts it took
 * or what any of them claimed.
 *
 * The old process's release-baton gate (`--thread`, `--force-without-baton`,
 * reading `docs/development/kickoffs/BATON.md` from `main`) was removed with that
 * process's tooling in T19 (K648, K749): who cuts a release is the process's
 * question, not this script's.
 *
 * A TEST DEPLOY (bundler R40; K4180, K4186): `--test-instance` deploys a named branch's BUILT plane bundle, unsigned, to a
 * trial copy. It is for a copy the environment marks as a test instance (CIVICSMITH_TEST_INSTANCE names it) in the
 * test account only; any other copy and any other account is refused before a request is made. It reads no signed
 * release: the bytes deployed are the file given, verified by reading them back as ever. Each step logs what it
 * deploys and the target it can return to. `--dry-run` runs every check and read and deploys nothing.
 *
 * THE CRON SCHEDULE (G1; K4565, K4566, K4570): after the upload the script's schedules are PUT from wrangler.jsonc's
 * `triggers.crons` and read back, and a failure or a difference refuses success (a raw script PUT sets none, and whether it
 * keeps the ones held is unconfirmed). Needs the token scope the upload already uses (Workers Scripts Write). The first add
 * can take up to 15 minutes to propagate to the cron runner; the smoke waits.
 *
 * usage (bundler R17, R18, R34, R40), from bio-plane/:
 *   CF_TOKEN=... CF_ACCT=... node scripts/deploy.mjs <slug> <version> <asset> [--test-instance] [--dry-run]
