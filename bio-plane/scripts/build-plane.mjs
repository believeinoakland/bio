/* Build the PLANE into its committed one-part bundle, plus the manifest the
 * FL-9 gate reads — the plane's thin caller on agent-worker's pattern (FL-10).
 *
 * D-298 is why this exists: the committed `dist/bio-plane.bundled.mjs` was 114
 * commits stale against `src` and nothing could tell, because a test of the
 * artifact proves it WORKS, never that it MATCHES. The recipe lives in
 * `scripts/fleet-bundle.mjs` — ONE expression, shared with both fleet members
 * and with the gate that verifies all three.
 *
 * The build calls no step that generates a source file (bundler R16): the
 * bundle is cut from the committed sources alone, so a stale committed source
 * is named by the gate and never silently regenerated here.
 *
 * Run from bio-plane/: `npm run build`.
