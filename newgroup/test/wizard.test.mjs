/* The wizard, tested end to end against a scripted Cloudflare.
 *
 * Every outbound call the wizard makes is intercepted, matched, and answered
 * here, so the whole provisioning conversation is asserted: what was called,
 * in what order, carrying exactly what. The load-bearing assertions:
 *   - the OAuth access token appears in NOTHING the wizard emits
 *   - an install always carries the SQLite migration, the irreversible choice
 *   - generated secrets are long, distinct, and never a published value
 *   - refused R2 degrades to a working install with no bucket bindings
 *   - an update keeps the instance's bindings and carries no migration
 *   - a state mismatch stops everything before the token endpoint is touched
 *   - both upload paths bind SELF, so a deployed instance's monitoring is armed
 *   - both upload paths bind DAEMON_TOKEN (DIST-2), so monitoring runs scoped
 *     rather than on the ADMIN_TOKEN fallback, and the value is never displayed
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL: delete the `selfBinding(slug)` line from `uploadUpdate`'s
 * bindings in src/index.mjs -> the update block fails on "SELF bound on update
 * too, arming monitoring on copies installed before it existed" (the
 * already-installed instance that would never receive SELF) and on "the update's
 * SELF is a service binding" -> 101 passed, 2 failed. Deleting the
 * `opts.noSelf ? [] : [selfBinding(slug)]` line from `uploadInstall` instead ->
 * 98 passed, 5 failed (both install SELF assertions, plus the whole degrade
 * block, because there is no longer anything for Cloudflare to refuse).
 * BOTH RUN 2026-08-04, restored 103/103 green after each.
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL (D-297/IC-82): force the fleet-signature verdict true in
 * `installFleet` -> 129 passed, 2 failed: the dropped-member block watches a
 * member install under a signature that covers a different set, and the
 * signature sentence vanishes. Swallow the /2 statement refusal and substitute
 * a hand-built /1-style payload instead -> 130 passed, 1 failed — the
 * /2-refusal sentence arm — while the member still does NOT install, because
 * the signature layer beneath catches the substituted payload: the defences
 * are layered and the arm shows which one answered. BOTH RUN 2026-09-14,
 * restored byte-identically (sha256-verified), 131/131 green.
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL (DIST-3): change `establishPlan`'s 100328 arm to return
 * "paid" (ACCEPT the Free answer — the exact defect DEC-42's row names) ->
 * 112 passed, 5 failed, and the load-bearing failure NAMES free-town as the
 * half-installed instance with the damage counted: want [0,0] got [2,1], two
 * buckets and the script actually created past the refusal that should have
 * stopped them. A WEAKER arm was run first and is recorded because its result
 * teaches something: merely DELETING the 100328 check (not accepting it) ->
 * 114 passed, 3 failed with free-town still protected — the unverifiable-plan
 * refusal catches what the Free check no longer does, so the guard fails
 * SAFE rather than open. BOTH RUN 2026-09-14, restored byte-identically after
 * each (sha256-verified), 117/117 green.
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL (DIST-2): delete the `DAEMON_TOKEN` line from
 * `uploadUpdate`'s bindings -> 103 passed, 2 failed, the first failure naming
 * oak-watch, the already-installed instance that would never receive the
 * credential (the arm this item exists for). Delete the `DAEMON_TOKEN` line
 * from `uploadInstall` instead -> 101 passed, 4 failed (four secrets, distinct
 * count, the retry count, and the panel assertion failing BY NAME with
 * "DAEMON_TOKEN missing" rather than throwing — D-93 guarded inside a control).
 * BOTH RUN 2026-09-14, `newgroup/src/index.mjs` restored byte-identically after
 * each (sha256 a0f6cf1b…, verified by hash both times).
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL (D-436 item 3, DIST #4, 2026-09-22), DECLARED BEFORE ARMING and measured with the 0.71.0
 * embed: (N1) `groupNotice` returns "" -> 141 passed, 5 failed: the four CROSSING telling assertions (why, the
 * refused code, the act, the suggestion) and the unknown-version arm's CONDITIONAL one; (N2) `groupUnrecorded`
 * answers "certain" whatever ran before -> 145 passed, 1 failed: PAST THE LINE, told where nothing is owed;
 * (N3) the update calls op=instancegroupseed -> 143 passed, 3 failed: each arm's "never seeds". ALL AS DECLARED,
 * `newgroup/src/index.mjs` restored byte-identically after each (sha256 12e67385…, verified by hash).
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL (D-116, 2026-09-23), DECLARED BEFORE ARMING, whole suite 164/164 before and after: (W1) today's-main
 * reading — `servingVerdict` reads only `version` (`if (!capable) return` made `if (true) return`) -> 157 passed,
 * 7 failed: every D-116 lag arm (stale store, pre-D-116 store, stale member, installed-but-unbound member, members
 * unreported, the install lag) — each reporting the update DONE over the lag it should name; (W2) `reportsBuilds`
 * answers false -> 155 passed, 9 failed: the PIN on the plane this tree builds, the "every part" sentence, and the
 * same seven lag arms. ALL AS DECLARED, `newgroup/src/index.mjs` restored byte-identically after each (sha256
 * e8773248…, verified by sha256 AND byte compare). The plane half's controls are in
 * `bio-plane/test/d116-serving-builds.test.mjs`.
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL (DIST-6, 2026-09-23), DECLARED BEFORE ARMING, each arm ALONE, baseline 184/184: (A1) today's main
 * (`newgroup/src/index.mjs` at 4355bfda) -> 169 passed, 15 failed: every DIST-6 binding, SERVING, done and naming arm,
 * the first failure the PIN (`MEMBER_BINDINGS` absent) and then "INSTALL: the plane is bound to EACH member" — and NONE
 * of the 164 older arms; (A2) DROP ONE member's binding (ocr-worker filtered out of `memberBindings`) -> 174/10, each
 * failure naming OCR_WORKER null / ocr-worker UNBOUND; (A3) THE LIAR, every binding named right and pointing at the
 * PLANE ITSELF -> 174/10, the targets named by binding and each member read MISNAMED, the page not "running" and the
 * update not "Updated"; (A4) the liar pointing every binding at pdf-worker -> 174/10, likewise; (A5) the ORDER — the
 * install's first plane upload binds all three before they exist -> 181/3, the fake account's 10143 refusal NAMED
 * ("bind-town:AGENT_WORKER->agent-worker") and SELF lost. A5 FAILED NARROWER THAN DECLARED (the install arms were
 * declared to fail): the install's SELF-retry re-uploads with only the members present, so it RECOVERS the order
 * defect at the cost of SELF — recorded, not smoothed; (A6) a failed member upload not named at verify -> 182/2, both
 * "missing binding NAMED" arms (the install reads "Your copy is running." over a failed ocr-worker); (A7) the update's
 * first upload restates no member -> 180/4, the kept-bindings arm and the D-297-population arms. `newgroup/src/index.mjs`
 * restored after each by cp from a per-arm pristine copy and verified by sha256 AND byte compare (83b6af0d…).
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL (DIST-9, DIST #6, 2026-09-24), DECLARED BEFORE ARMING, each arm ALONE, baseline 200/200: (N1) THE
 * INVENTOR — `instanceAiBinding` generates `rand(32)` when no value is supplied (DAEMON_TOKEN's shape) -> 190 passed,
 * 10 failed: the four declared DIST-9 NO-INVENTION / KEPT arms by name, and the four older arms that count secrets
 * exactly (four secrets, distinct 4, the SELF-retry's 4, the update's "NO password"), as declared; PLUS two NOT
 * declared — both "supplied" arms — because the install's step-3 re-PUT and the update's bindMembers re-PUT pass no
 * value, so the inventor OVERWRITES the operator's value with its own. Recorded, not smoothed: it shows the no-invention
 * rule also protects a supplied value. (N2) `uploadUpdate` drops the binding -> 199/1, exactly "DIST-9 UPDATE,
 * supplied", as declared. `newgroup/src/index.mjs` restored after each by cp from a pristine copy, verified by sha256
 * (c53fa1ee…) AND byte compare; 200/200 after.

/* ---- D-116: EACH PART'S OWN BUILD, READ BACK, AND THE ONE THAT LAGS NAMED ----------------------------------------
   Added 2026-09-23 (D-116 worker). A release whose plane carries D-116 answers `op=bootstrap&members=1` with three
   readings, each from where it runs: `version` (the routing isolate), `storeVersion` (the Durable Object's own env) and
   `memberVersions` (each member's own /version THROUGH the plane's binding; bio-plane/test/d116-serving-builds.test.mjs
   drives the plane half with a real DO on another build). This half drives the INSTALLER's reading of that answer.
   HOW A LIAR WOULD PASS HERE: an installer that read only `version` (today's main) — every arm below that names a
   lagging store or member serves a CORRECT `version`, so only a reader of the other two fields can name the lag.
   NEGATIVE CONTROL: see the D-116 entry at the head of this file's controls. */

/* ---- DIST-6: THE INSTALLED PLANE IS BOUND TO THE MEMBERS INSTALLED BESIDE IT ---------------------------------------
   Added 2026-09-23 (DIST-6 worker). Until DIST-6 neither upload path bound PDF_WORKER / OCR_WORKER / AGENT_WORKER, so a
   group's copy held its members uploaded and unreachable. The D-116 arms above serve a CANNED `memberVersions`; these
   do not. Here the account is a small STATEFUL fake: it keeps every script uploaded, applies `keep_bindings` by type
   (so a service binding not restated is DROPPED, as the update's comment says it is), REFUSES a PUT whose service
   binding names a worker the account does not hold (code 10143 — the rule `tools/deploy-fleet.mjs` records as measured
   2026-08-10 / 2026-09-10, which forces the order), and answers `op=bootstrap&members=1` the way the plane's
   `memberVersions` does, DERIVED from the bindings the plane was last uploaded with: no binding -> UNBOUND; a binding
   to a member script -> that script's own name and VERSION (so a binding to the wrong worker reads MISNAMED); a binding
   to nothing -> SILENT. The binding names are read from the PLANE'S SOURCE (`FLEET_BINDINGS`), never restated here.
   HOW A LIAR WOULD PASS: a binding named right and pointing anywhere but the member — every arm below asserts each
   binding's TARGET by name, and the fake plane reads such a binding MISNAMED, so the verify step names it too. */

/* ---- DIST-9 (D-260's deploy half): THE ORGANISATION `ai` CREDENTIAL IS CARRIED, NEVER INVENTED ---------------------
   Added 2026-09-24 (DIST #6). The plane reads the Worker secret INSTANCE_AI_TOKEN since D-260 and resumes the woken runs
   that credential opened; nothing placed it. Install and update now CARRY a value the operator supplies, as DAEMON_TOKEN
   is carried, and differ from DAEMON_TOKEN in the load-bearing way: none supplied -> NONE SENT (a member mints the
   credential on the copy, DS-3; an invented value names no principal). HOW A LIAR WOULD PASS: generate a value when
   none is given (the DAEMON_TOKEN `|| rand(32)` shape) — the NO-INVENTION arms read every plane PUT for the binding.
   NEGATIVE CONTROL: see the DIST-9 entry below this block's arms. */
