/* Part 2 of the BIO installer: the wizard Worker.
 *
 * Lives at newgroup.believeinoakland.workers.dev. Serves the wizard page,
 * receives the OAuth return, and provisions the team's instance into THEIR
 * Cloudflare account, server-side. Server-side because it must be: the
 * management API answers no CORS preflight, so a browser can never call it
 * with an Authorization header. Tested twice; do not re-test hoping for a
 * different answer.
 *
 * Custody of the access token, and the guarantees this file keeps:
 *   - The token is scoped to exactly five permissions (R2), granted on a consent
 *     screen the user reads, revocable from their dashboard, short-lived.
 *   - It exists in a local variable for the seconds provisioning takes. This
 *     Worker has NO storage bindings of any kind, so there is nowhere to
 *     write it even by mistake. Statelessness is structural, not promised.
 *   - It is never echoed into HTML, logs, or error text. The test suite
 *     asserts its absence from every byte this Worker emits.
 *
 * The one failure we cannot put a sentence on screen for: a redirect URL
 * mismatch fails on Cloudflare's side before the user ever returns here.
 * REDIRECT below must remain character-identical to the URL registered on
 * the OAuth client. When the domain moves, add the new URL alongside the old
 * on the client, deploy, verify a real run, then remove the old.
