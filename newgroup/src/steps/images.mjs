/* R38, R23 (T46; N897 (4); `draft-T46-trial.md` §3.2) — WHETHER A CONTAINER MEMBER'S IMAGE CAN BE PULLED, AND WHAT YOUR
 * GROUP'S CIVICSMITH LACKS WITHOUT IT, held once for the fleet step (index.mjs) and the install and update pages (ui.mjs).
 *
 * A container member installs under the default scheduling policy only from a registry that policy pulls from: Docker
 * Hub, Amazon ECR, Google Artifact Registry (the Cloudflare registry is the `durable_object` policy's, which this installer
 * never uses), and only pinned to one exact build by its sha256 digest. A release whose image sits anywhere else (GitHub's
 * registry, today: there is no public registry yet, K2816 (4)) is left out by name, in words a group can read: never "not
 * a public registry image". The member names stay as the fleet statement gives them; what each provides is said beside.
