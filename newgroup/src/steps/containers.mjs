/* R38 (M-Q8) — THE CONTAINER MEMBER (agent-runner: Claude Code in a container, a member's own subscription path;
 * file-scanner: ClamAV and the safe view, two containers, T36).
 *
 * The signed fleet statement (`bio-release-fleet/2`) has no image field, and adding one would make every older
 * installer's rebuilt statement disagree with the signature. So a container member is an ordinary member (its asset is
 * the Worker that exports the Container Durable Object classes, K1615) carrying one more part of type `Container` per
 * class: a JSON descriptor, fetched and hashed like any part, which the fleet signature therefore covers:
 *   {class_name, image: "<repository>@sha256:<64 hex>", scheduling_policy: "default", max_instances, bind: [{member, binding}]}
 * One class is the part `container.json`, as before; two or more (T36, bundler R25) are `container/<class_name>.json`
 * each, the path naming the class its descriptor names. An older installer meets a part type it does not know and
 * leaves that one member out by name (R11's rule).
 *
 * It installs only when all of these hold: the permission granted carries the Containers write scope (R2), the account
 * is on Workers Paid (R6), and every descriptor names an image the default scheduling policy can pull, pinned by digest
 * (images.mjs; T46: one it cannot pull is named "not yet published where your Cloudflare account can pull it"). Then:
 * the Worker is uploaded (with its classes' migration when the script is new, and bound to each class it reaches
 * itself), the Containers application of each class is created for that class's namespace with its image, or, when it
 * exists, rolled out to the image; and each other member a descriptor names is uploaded with a cross-script binding to
 * the class. Any condition failing leaves the member out, named with what the copy then lacks (images.mjs, CONTAINER_LACKS): the
 * install never fails over it. The Containers API calls are wrangler's own (`/accounts/<id>/containers/applications`,
 * `…/rollouts`); like the install's SELF binding, they are confirmed only by a real install, which is deploy-gated. */
