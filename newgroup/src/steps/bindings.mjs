/* REC-26 / D-102 again: the instance name IS the worker name, so a Worker's
   binding to ITSELF names the same `slug` the group already chose. This is what
   the plane's `#monitorConfigured()` looks for, and without it BOTH monitoring
   consumers — CAP-3's archive fallback and REC-26's monitor cadence — contribute
   no wake and hold no alarm: built, tested, and wired to nothing on every
   installed instance (MACHINE-PROCESSES.md §0). A loopback service binding is the
   only way a Durable Object can reach its own control plane, which is how those
   consumers fire the SAME ops a caller uses (D-112: one path, no drift).

   THE CREDENTIAL, decided 2026-08-04 (DIST-1) and deliberately NOT a new secret:
   the plane's `#monitorToken()` is `env.MONITOR_TOKEN || env.ADMIN_TOKEN`, but its
   `classify()` recognises only the binding credentials it names (ADMIN_TOKEN, PROBE_TOKEN, DAEMON_TOKEN; no
   MEMBER_TOKEN since N711: the shared member key is retired, R9, and members sign in with their own sessions). Binding a
   MONITOR_TOKEN here — and nothing else — would make every tick SELECT a token the
   plane then refuses, while `#monitorConfigured()` stayed true: an armed alarm
   firing 401s forever, which is worse than the ADMIN_TOKEN it replaced. The scoped
   credential was a DELEGATION to RECORD (2026-08-04 DIST → RECORD) that landed as
   REC-33: classify() now recognises DAEMON_TOKEN as the daemon class, reaching
   exactly two ops, and #monitorToken() prefers it. So the constraint above is
   satisfied in the required order and BOTH upload paths bind DAEMON_TOKEN below
   (DIST-2). The ADMIN_TOKEN fallback remains in the plane until DEC-43's
   retirement conditions are measured (DIST-4's count); an instance that never
   updates keeps monitoring on ADMIN_TOKEN, which is exactly the population that
   report exists to name. */

/* DIST-6 — THE PLANE IS BOUND TO THE FLEET MEMBERS INSTALLED BESIDE IT (`BIO_Distribution_v0_1.md` §2, §4).
 *
 * Until DIST-6 both upload paths below bound the plane its buckets, its secrets and SELF and NOTHING ELSE, so on a
 * group's own copy `installFleet` uploaded pdf-worker, ocr-worker and agent-worker and the plane could reach none of
 * them: tier-2/3 extraction and the assistant member did nothing there (found by D-116's worker, 2026-09-23; D-116's
 * verify step read each member UNBOUND). The binding NAMES are the plane's own, instance-setup's `FLEET_BINDINGS`,
 * imported (R30); the TARGET is the script name `installFleet` uploads each member under (`m.member`), never the
 * plane's slug and never a name in a file. A member absent from that list (a release naming a member the plane does not
 * call) is uploaded and not bound.
 *
 * THE ORDER, and the evidence it rests on. Cloudflare REFUSES an upload whose service binding names a worker that does
 * not exist — measured here, not read in a vendor page: `bio-plane/scripts/deploy-fleet.mjs` records the refusal
 * ("Service binding 'PLANE' references Worker 'bio-plane' which was not found [code: 10143]"), measured 2026-08-10
 * and re-measured 2026-09-10. And agent-worker's own manifest binds PLANE -> the plane's slug. So the fleet and the
 * plane bind EACH OTHER, and neither can be uploaded first holding a binding to the other on a fresh account: members
 * first would be refused on agent-worker's PLANE exactly as the plane-first upload would be refused on AGENT_WORKER.
 * The order that needs no assumption about binding to a missing worker is therefore THREE acts:
 *   1. the plane, bound only to the members the account ALREADY holds (`membersPresent`; none on a fresh account);
 *   2. the members (`installFleet`), whose PLANE binding now resolves;
 *   3. the plane RE-PUT, bound to every member now present (`bindMembers`) — only when step 2 added one.
 * Step 1 binding what already exists is what keeps an UPDATE from un-binding a working copy's members for the
 * duration of the update, or for good when the fleet step cannot run (the repository unreachable): `service` is not
 * in `keep_bindings`, so a member not restated in a PUT is a member dropped. */
