 * `CLAUDE.md` §5: a deploy verified is not a build serving).
 *
 * `op=bootstrap`'s `version` is the ROUTING isolate's build. Until D-116 that was the only thing this checked, so an
 * update whose Durable Object — the part holding the record — still ran the previous build, or whose capability
 * worker never took the new one, reported "Updated" all the same. A plane carrying D-116 answers three readings,
 * each from where it runs: `version` (the isolate), `storeVersion` (the DO's own env, never the isolate's), and on
 * `members=1`, `memberVersions` (each member's own `/version`, asked THROUGH the plane's binding). Every one must
 * equal the release, and the one that does not is NAMED; the update and the install do not report success until
 * none lags.
 *
 * WHETHER THE RELEASE CAN ANSWER is read from the plane bytes this act uploaded (`reportsBuilds`), never from a
 * version number: a release cut before D-116 landed has neither field in its source, so its store's build and its
 * members' are UNDETERMINED and the page says so in the same breath as the isolate's confirmation (UNDETERMINED_BUILDS)
 * — never a silent "confirmed", and never a refusal for lacking a field that release could not have. A plane that SHOULD answer and does not is a lag, not an absence:
 * after uploading a release that carries the fields, a reply without `storeVersion` is a DO still on older code. */
