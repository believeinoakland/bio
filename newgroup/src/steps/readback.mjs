   either as the module itself or as a multipart body whose `index.mjs` part is the module (as `deploy.mjs` reads it).

   them) and costs several copies of a 21 MB module, past a Worker's 128 MB. The download is read as a stream and hashed
   incrementally (R38): the part is found as the chunks arrive and its bytes go to the hash; no copy of the body is held. */
