/* R20 (DIST-15, N336) — THE PLANE'S LIMITS, AS THE SIGNED RELEASE STATES THEM.
 *
 * DIST-7 sent a constant pinned to the plane's config, so an installer installing a later release with another ceiling
 * still sent its own. Now the plane's code states its limits (control-plane's statement, equal to `bio-plane/wrangler.jsonc`'s
 * `limits`), so the bundle a release signs carries them, and this reads them from the bytes R8 chose and verified: the
 * installer holds no value of its own. The statement is a string literal, `bio-plane-limits/1 key=n …`, because a bundler
 * rewrites numbers, renames constants and changes quotes, and a string's text survives all three; the bundle cannot be
 * executed here (a Worker imports no string), so it is read as text. Nothing is added to the fleet statement: the
 * limits ride inside the plane bytes the release signature and the fleet statement's plane hash already cover, so an
 * older installer still verifies the fleet signature of a release that carries them.
 *
 * `{ok: true, limits}`; or `{ok: false, why: "none"}` (no statement); or `{ok: false, why: "unreadable", detail}` (two
 * different statements, or one not of the form). */
