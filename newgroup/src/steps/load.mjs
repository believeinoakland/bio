 * Every part comes from ONE release's own signed fleet statement: the plane just chosen, and the statement its own manifest
 * carries (the built-in release carries its own, embedded with it and signed with it: `RELEASE_MANIFEST`), never the plane of
 * one release paired with the statement of another (S3). The statement is rebuilt from the manifest and verified in the fleet
 * namespace, its plane must be the plane this act installs and its version this release's, and each member's bundle and
 * parts are fetched and hashed against it. A source that is slow or down is waited on and then named (`SourceUnavailable`,
 * F5): the caller stops with nothing created. What cannot be loaded for one member leaves that member out, named (R11).
 * Answers `{skip}` (a sentence saying why no member is installed this time) or `{members, fleet}`. */
