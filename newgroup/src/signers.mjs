/* The keys this installer will trust to have signed a release.
 *
 * A hash in RELEASE.json proves the bytes were not corrupted in transit.
 * It proves nothing about who put them there: whoever can write the
 * repository can write both the asset and the hash of the asset. A
 * signature is the part that names a person, and the only copy of the
 * public key that matters is this one, compiled into the installer the
 * group is already trusting to touch their account.
 *
 * Empty means unarmed: the installer verifies hashes, notes plainly that
 * releases are not yet signed, and installs. Once a key is listed, an
 * unsigned or wrongly signed repository release is refused outright and
 * the built-in copy installs instead. Adding the first key is a
 * deliberate act by the maintainer, not a default.
 *
 * R43 (T36; N712, K1936 Q4 step 1; Distribution §10): this list holds exactly two lines, the fresh release key and the
 * offline recovery key, each generated on the signer page with a passphrase, and never the development key the page
 * minted without one. Both were made at Bob's signer-page sitting of 2026-10-12 (K2922, K2930), replacing the
 * development key in this one change on the 0.82.0 cut, which is signed with the fresh key and embedded here.
 *
 * R43 (T48; N1047, K3158; `signatures` R45): the two lines are no longer written here. `signatures` holds the one list
 * (`RELEASE_KEYS`), and this array is read from it when the module loads, so the installer and every plane module that
 * verifies a release trust exactly the same keys and a rotation is one edit, there. The array stays an array of its own so
 * that a test can arm another key for one act; the shipped contents are `RELEASE_KEYS`'. */
