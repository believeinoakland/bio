/* Embeds the current bio-plane release into the wizard as a string, so the
 * wizard uploads exactly one module into the group's account and depends on
 * no repository, no CDN, and no second fetch at install time.
 *
 * Run from newgroup/: `npm run embed`. Expects the sibling ../bio-plane tree
 * with its devDependencies installed (esbuild does the bundling there).
 *
 * WHY THIS REFUSES (D-106, 2026-07-31). The installer shipped 0.35.0 while the
 * plane ran 0.48.0, thirteen releases, and nobody noticed. The cause was not a
 * forgotten build step: this script read the embedded version out of
 * `bio-plane/wrangler.jsonc`, and NOTHING ELSE IN THE TREE READS THAT FIELD.
 * `scripts/deploy.mjs` binds VERSION from its command line, so every release
 * since 0.35.0 deployed correctly while the config literal sat untouched. A
 * field with exactly one reader, and that reader a build step whose output
 * nobody inspects, is a field that rots invisibly. Re-running the old script
 * today would still have embedded 0.35.0.
 *
 * So: `bio-plane/package.json` is the AUTHORITY, because that is the version a
 * release is cut from and the version RELEASE.json carries. Every other place
 * the version appears must agree with it or this refuses to build. The check is
 * equality, never a comparison: "newer" is not a defence, because a wrangler
 * config ahead of package.json is the same class of drift in the other
 * direction and equally worth stopping.
 *
 * WHY THIS NO LONGER BUILDS (2026-09-18, DIST). This script used to run
 * `npm run build` in bio-plane and embed whatever the working tree compiled
 * to, labelled with package.json's version. Between releases that is NOT the
 * signed release: measured on 5ea27761, the committed embed was the signed
 * 0.58.0 asset (sha256 72fce1e9...) and one `npm run embed` replaced it with
 * an unsigned build of 834 later commits (9efea448...) still calling itself
 * 0.58.0. `npm test` and `npm run build` both ran it, so the installer's own
 * gate put an unsigned plane under a signed version's name, and the installer
 * installs its built-in copy WITHOUT verifying it (it is the fallback). So the
 * embed now COPIES the signed asset from release/ and refuses unless the bytes
 * hash to RELEASE.json's sha256, carry a signature that verifies against the
 * installer's own ARMED_SIGNERS, and name the version package.json names.
 * It builds nothing and is idempotent: between cuts it rewrites the same file.
