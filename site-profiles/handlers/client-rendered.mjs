/* A client-rendered application, where the served HTML is a shell.
 *
 * MEASURED, oaklandca.opengov.com/transparency, 2026-07-30: the capture succeeded,
 * the bytes hashed clean, and the document carried ZERO anchors and no evidentiary
 * content of any kind. Everything a member would have wanted to cite is assembled
 * by script in a browser after the bytes arrive.
 *
 * This handler exists to say so, loudly, at capture time. It is the one case where
 * a technically perfect capture is evidentially worthless, and the danger is
 * specific: the bytes are stable, they hash consistently, monitoring will report
 * "unchanged" forever, and the record will look diligent while holding nothing.
 * Silence here is worse than any of the other failures in this package, because
 * every other one is noisy.
 *
 * Per the standing ruling, JS-rendered content IS the content and must be captured
 * as evidence at the SAME GRADE as the rest of the document, because the render
 * happened in the site's own execution environment at capture time. That needs the
 * browser-rendering path, and until a capture takes that path on this kind of
 * document, this handler's job is to report that what was captured is a shell.
