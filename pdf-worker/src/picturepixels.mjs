/* picturepixels.mjs — a PICTURE FILE (a JPEG or a PNG a member uploaded, a
 * photographed page) as upright grey PNG pixels small enough to send on:
 * pdf-pixels R42 and R43 (T43; N853b; K2611, K2691).
 *
 * WHY IT NEVER HANDS ON THE FILE'S OWN BYTES. A page renderer's DCT pass-through
 * (`pagepixels.mjs`, R22) gives the publisher's JPEG untouched; this does not.
 * agent-worker R63 (Bob's K1888) admits only pixels this system made, so a
 * picture is always decoded, turned, made grey and re-encoded here: a PNG's text
 * chunks, an EXIF block or anything else the file carries never reaches the
 * model. The answer is a PNG this module wrote, or a stated refusal.
 *
 * WHAT "CORRECT" MEANS. Every step is Pillow's own, so an independent reader can
 * reproduce `pixels_sha256`: `ImageOps.exif_transpose` (R43), `convert("L")`
 * (ITU-R 601-2 luma in Pillow's fixed point, `Convert.c`'s `L24`) and
 * `reduce(k)` (`Reduce.c`: a box average whose division is Pillow's fixed-point
 * multiplier, with partial boxes on the right and bottom edges averaged over the
 * pixels present). The JPEG decode is image-codecs' R1, bit-exact with libjpeg;
 * the PNG decode is its R10.
 *
 * MEMORY. A 48-megapixel colour photo is 145 MB of samples, more than the
 * isolate's 128 MB. So a JPEG is decoded WHILE it is reduced (T44; N868): the
 * decoder hands over a strip of finished rows at a time (image-codecs R11) and
 * each row is summed, grey when asked, into the one band of boxes it falls in;
 * only the small picture is kept. The full frame is judged from the HEADER,
 * before anything is allocated, against `PICTURE_SOURCE_MAX`, the reduced one
 * against `PICTURE_FRAME_MAX`. A PNG is still decoded whole (image-codecs R10),
 * so its full frame is judged against `PICTURE_FRAME_MAX` (T43-5's measure).
 *
 * THE PREPARATION (R44; T51, FR-42, K4194). With `prepare: true` the grey picture
 * is also made ready for the engine: the light levelled, the lines turned level,
 * small print enlarged (`preparePicture`). The engine reads a photograph of a
 * page at 43 % of its words without it. Without `prepare` the answer is R42's.
