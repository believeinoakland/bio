/* pdf-worker — the first member of the function-specific Worker fleet (I6).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The plane stays a lean control/record Worker. `unpdf`
 * (pdf.js) is heavy and cannot live in the plane: adding it to the plane's
 * module graph broke 21 miniflare suites, because a bare npm specifier does not
 * resolve in the plane's un-bundled source (MEASUREMENTS.md, 2026-07-31). So the
 * dependency-laden Tier-2 text path moves into THIS dedicated Worker, which the
 * plane calls over a service binding. A fleet, not a monolith.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES. Given a capture sha and a store namespace, it reads the captured
 * bytes FROM R2 ITSELF (the `CAPTURES` read binding — never handed the bytes,
 * because the document too large to hold in the plane is exactly the document
 * this exists for, I6) and returns the record's I2 structure+text shape — the
 * record's own vocabulary, never a pdf.js object (fleet rule 1). Tier 2 handles
 * the residue Tier 1 cannot decode: CID / no-/ToUnicode fonts, and permission-
 * only ENCRYPTED PDFs (pdf.js decrypts an empty-user-password PDF transparently;
 * CPDF-5).
 *
 * WHAT IT MUST NOT DO (fleet rules 2/3, I6):
 *   - WRITE ANYTHING. No register row, no provenance, no capture, no task. It
 *     returns derived structure and the plane decides what it means; a hop a
 *     component can hand us is a hop a component can invent (D-112). It holds no
 *     STORE (Durable Object) binding, so it structurally CANNOT write the record,
 *     and it never calls .put/.delete on R2 (R37 in `test/structure.test.mjs`:
 *     CAPTURES is only ever .get, and the bucket is unchanged after calls).
 *   - Hold a `PUBLISHED` binding. `CAPTURES` read is the whole of its need; every
 *     Worker inside the private fence must stay named and minimal.
 *   - Be reached by anything but the plane. It has no member-facing surface and
 *     no token classes; the plane's op layer is the authorisation boundary.
 *
 * It versions and deploys SEPARATELY (fleet rule 4): a verification must
 * establish which build ANSWERED for the member as well as the plane — so
 * `GET /version` exists, added by CPDF-9 (IC-33). Until then that rule was
 * UNVERIFIABLE here: nothing on this member's wire named its build, while
 * `wrangler.jsonc` had carried `vars.VERSION` since the member was written and
 * no handler ever read it. D-108 is what that costs — a byte-identical
 * verification of 0.52.0 followed seconds later by `/version` answering 0.51.0,
 * one component out and with no endpoint to ask.

/* D-478 — THE NAMESPACES THIS MEMBER WILL READ FROM: EXACTLY `bio` OR `scratch`, AND NOTHING ELSE.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG, AND WHY IT IS A RECORD DEFECT RATHER THAN A WRITE DEFECT. The store test here read
 * `/^[a-z0-9_-]+$/i` — "a namespace token" — so `biosmoke`, `Scratch` and any other well-shaped name was accepted
 * and spent as the R2 key prefix `<store>/captures/<sha>`. Nothing was ever written (this member holds no STORE
 * binding and never calls .put/.delete; IC-237 measured it), so the bucket was safe — but the ANSWER was not:
 * a bucket with no key under a prefix that does not exist answers the same 404 `NOT_FOUND` as a capture that is
 * genuinely absent from a real namespace. That is the one conflation CLAUDE.md §1 names outright — *not found* is
 * not *absent* — and it is the worse half of the pair, because the caller reads a fact about the CAPTURE where
 * the truth is a fact about the NAME it asked under. A member that answers NOT_FOUND under a namespace no
 * instance holds is the record claiming more than it can support.
 *
 * WHY THE PLANE'S SPELLING IS HONEST HERE. The plane's set is not per instance: `namespaceGate` holds
 * `Object.freeze(["bio", SCRATCH])` in code, so the fact this member states — "no such namespace exists" — is the
 * same fact on every instance it can be bound to (D-456, C-78.1, IC-237; the member side for `agent-worker` is
 * D-462/IC-253 and this is its I6 half). It is kept here as a COPY because a fleet member cannot import the
 * plane's `index.mjs`, and a copy ages; `test/structure.test.mjs` reads the plane's `NAMESPACES` from its source
 * and requires this set to equal it, so the day the plane gains a namespace this member's suite goes red. The set
 * is exact and case-sensitive for the plane's reason: a Durable Object name, and an R2 key, is an exact string.
 *
 * NOT NAMING ONE IS A DIFFERENT CONDITION and keeps its old code, BAD_STORE — but it is now the condition it
 * always claimed to be: `store` ABSENT or not a string. An empty `store: ""` is a NAMED value and meets
 * NAMESPACE_UNKNOWN with the rest, which is the same line `agent-worker` draws. */
