/* A throwaway entry point that exists so `pagepixels.mjs` can be driven INSIDE
 * WORKERD rather than only in node. The placement question CPDF-12 answers is
 * "does this run in the runtime a fleet member actually runs in", and a module
 * that passes in node has answered a different question — CPDF-5 paid for that
 * distinction when pdf.js threw `Math.sumPrecise is not a function` on node and
 * ran clean on workerd.
 *
 * It is NOT the member's surface: `pdf-worker/src/index.mjs` declares the fleet
 * surface, and adding a route there is a change to I6 that belongs with the
 * CPDF-10 item that will consume the pixels, not with the measurement that
 * establishes they exist. This file is imported only by the probe and by the
 * suite's workerd arm.
