/* mq.mjs — the MQ arithmetic decoder, shared by `jbig2decode.mjs` (ITU-T T.88
 * Annex E) and `jpxdecode.mjs` (ITU-T T.800 Annex C). The two standards define
 * the same coder with the same 47-state probability table, so there is ONE
 * implementation here rather than two that could drift apart.
 *
 * The register convention is T.800 C.3's: C is not inverted, BYTEIN adds the
 * next byte at bit 8 (bit 9 after a stuffed 0xFF), and a marker (0xFF followed
 * by a byte above 0x8F) feeds 1-bits for ever without advancing. The LPS test
 * is `Chigh < Qe`, taken before the interval is renormalised, which is the form
 * both reference decoders use (jbig2dec's software convention and OpenJPEG's
 * `opj_mqc_decode`) and which gives the same decisions as T.88's Figure E.15.
 *
 * WHAT THE DATA RUNNING OUT MEANS differs between the two callers, so it is
 * COUNTED here and judged by the caller. A JPEG 2000 code-block's terminated
 * segment may legitimately be read past its end (OpenJPEG appends an artificial
 * 0xFFFF marker for exactly that). A JBIG2 segment may not: jbig2dec treats a
 * read beyond the segment's data as fatal, and a stream cut short would
 * otherwise decode to a plausible picture made of the 1-bits the coder invents.
 * `overrun` counts the bytes the decoder needed and did not have.
