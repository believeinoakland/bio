/* CPDF-18 — THE CANDIDATE TABLE-RECOGNITION STEP, AS MEASURED. PROBE-ONLY.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT A TABLE READER AND NOTHING IN THE PRODUCT IMPORTS IT. The CPDF-18
 * row is explicit that no table reader is built whatever the verdict; this file
 * is the SUBJECT of a GO/NO-GO measurement (`table-recognition.probe.mjs`), kept
 * in `test/` beside the probe so a re-run measures exactly what was measured.
 *
 * WHY THIS CANDIDATE. The runtime has exactly one component that knows where
 * text sits on a PDF page: pdf.js (`unpdf`), already in this member and GO on
 * workerd since CPDF-6. pdf.js recognises no tables. The step measured is
 * therefore the classical GEOMETRIC ("stream") method — the family Tabula's
 * stream mode and pdfplumber's text strategy belong to — reduced to its core:
 * rows are baselines, cells are text runs separated by a wide horizontal gap,
 * and a table is a run of consecutive multi-cell rows whose cells line up in
 * columns. It is deterministic by construction, which is exactly why the
 * probe does NOT accept reproducibility alone as a GO (see the probe header).
 *
 * THE CONSTANTS ARE DECLARED AND FROZEN BEFORE THE MEASUREMENT, and a re-tune
 * after seeing the scores would turn a measurement into a fit.
